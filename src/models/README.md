# Models

This directory contains model-related code for machine learning models used in the application.

## Structure

- `face/`: Face detection model integration
- `eye/`: Eye contact detection model integration

The models directory is responsible for:
- Loading and initializing machine learning models
- Providing interfaces for model inference
- Managing model resources and optimization
- Converting input data to the format required by models
- Processing model outputs into application-usable data
