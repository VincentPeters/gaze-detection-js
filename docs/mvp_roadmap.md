## MVP Success Criteria

[ ] **MVP Launch Readiness Checklist**

1. **Functional Complete:**
   - [ ] User can launch the application and see webcam feed
   - [ ] Face detection works in real-time with visual indicators
   - [ ] Eye contact detection provides binary yes/no feedback
   - [ ] Screenshots are captured when eye contact is detected
   - [ ] Basic configuration is savable and loadable

2. **"Good Enough" Quality:**
   - [ ] Face detection works at minimum 15 fps on target hardware
   - [ ] Eye contact detection has accuracy comparable to Python version
   - [ ] Application doesn't crash during normal usage
   - [ ] UI is simple but clearly indicates detection status
   - [ ] Screenshots are saved in a designated folder with timestamps
