## Project Overview

This roadmap outlines the development process for refactoring the Python-based Eye Contact Detection application into a JavaScript-based solution using Electron, React, face-api.js, and TensorFlow.js.

## Conclusion

This development roadmap provides a structured approach to refactoring the Python-based Eye Contact Detection application into a JavaScript-based solution. By breaking down the project into logical phases and features, the roadmap ensures a systematic development process that builds functionality incrementally.

Each feature focuses on WHAT needs to be accomplished without prescribing HOW it should be implemented, allowing the development team to determine the best implementation approach. The dependencies between features ensure that the system is built on solid foundations, with each component building upon previously established functionality.

The next step is to create detailed feature documents for each of the features identified in this roadmap, followed by task documents that further break down the implementation work.
