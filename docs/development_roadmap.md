### Key Requirements

- Real-time face detection and tracking
- Eye contact detection using a converted model
- Multi-window interface for camera feed and detected faces
- Media capture (screenshots and video) when eye contact is detected
- Configuration system with adjustable parameters
- Logging and feedback system
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)

3. **Performance Monitoring:** Continuously monitor and optimize performance, especially for real-time processing tasks.

4. **Cross-Platform Awareness:** Consider platform differences early in the design process, especially for camera access, file system operations, and UI rendering.

5. **Backwards Compatibility:** Ensure compatibility with existing assets and configuration files from the Python version.

### Decision Framework

When making implementation decisions, consider:

1. **Performance Impact:** How will this choice affect real-time processing capabilities?

2. **Maintainability:** Will this approach be understandable and maintainable by future developers?

3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Does this work consistently across all target platforms?

4. **User Experience:** How does this affect the end-user experience?

5. **Development Efficiency:** Does this approach allow for efficient development and iteration?
