# Post-MVP Iteration Framework

This framework outlines the approach for rapidly improving the Gaze Detection application after the MVP launch, based on user feedback and observed performance.

## 1. Feedback Collection

### User Feedback Mechanisms
- [ ] **In-App Feedback Form**
  - Simple form accessible from the main interface
  - Captures specific issues, enhancement requests, and general feedback
  - Includes optional contact information for follow-up

- [ ] **Usage Metrics** (with user permission)
  - Detection success rate (% of time faces are detected)
  - Eye contact detection frequency
  - Performance metrics (FPS, memory usage)
  - Feature usage patterns

- [ ] **Issue Categorization**
  - Technical issues (crashes, performance problems)
  - Accuracy concerns (false positives/negatives)
  - Usability feedback (UI, workflow)
  - Feature requests

### Prioritization Framework
| Category | Description | Priority Level |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Blockers | Prevents core functionality | P0 - Immediate |
| Critical | Severely impacts core experience | P1 - Next Release |
| Important | Significantly affects usability | P2 - Planned |
| Enhancement | Improves experience but not essential | P3 - Backlog |
| Future Feature | New capability beyond core | P4 - Roadmap |

## 2. Rapid Response Process

### Issue Triage Workflow
1. **Daily Review** of new feedback (15-minute standup)
2. **Categorize** each issue using the framework above
3. **Assign** P0/P1 issues immediately
4. **Schedule** P2/P3 for appropriate iteration

### Fix Cycles
- **Emergency Fixes** (P0)
  - 24-hour turnaround
  - Limited scope to just fixing the blocker
  - Expedited testing and release

- **Regular Fixes** (P1/P2)
  - 2-3 day cycles
  - Batched with other similar priority items
  - Standard testing before release

### Validation Process
1. **Reproduce** the reported issue
2. **Implement** targeted fix
3. **Verify** fix addresses the issue
4. **Regression Test** core functionality
5. **Release** update to affected users

## 3. Incremental Enhancement

### Enhancement Cycles
Each cycle focuses on a specific area of improvement with a 1-2 week timeframe.

#### Cycle 1: Multi-Face Optimization
- Optimize face tracking for multiple simultaneous faces
- Improve performance with multiple detection instances
- Enhance UI to clearly indicate multiple face states
- Add basic analytics for multiple face scenarios

#### Cycle 2: Video Recording
- Implement video recording on eye contact
- Add configuration for recording duration and quality
- Create video preview functionality
- Implement video export options

#### Cycle 3: Advanced Configuration UI
- Create detailed configuration panel
- Add preset management
- Implement configuration import/export
- Add visual configuration guides

#### Cycle 4: Performance Optimization
- Profile and optimize detection pipeline
- Reduce memory usage
- Improve startup time
- Optimize for lower-end hardware

### Development Guidelines
- **Scope Control**: Limit each enhancement cycle to a focused area
- **Risk Management**: Implement more complex features incrementally
- **Technical Debt**: Allocate 20% of each cycle to reducing technical debt
- **Documentation**: Update documentation with each enhancement
- **Testing**: Maintain or improve test coverage with each addition

## 4. Release Strategy

### Release Cadence
- **Hotfixes** (P0): As needed, immediate
- **Minor Updates** (P1): Weekly
- **Feature Releases** (P2/P3): Bi-weekly
- **Major Enhancements**: End of each enhancement cycle

### Release Process
1. **Build** release candidate
2. **Test** on reference hardware
3. **Document** changes and new features
4. **Package** for distribution
5. **Release Notes** with clear explanation of changes
6. **Announcement** to user base

## 5. Sustainable Development

### Code Quality Maintenance
- Refactor as patterns emerge
- Maintain consistent coding standards
- Regular dependency updates
- Incremental architecture improvements

### User Communication
- Transparent roadmap shared with users
- Regular updates on progress
- Clear explanation of priorities
- Acknowledgment of user contributions

### Decision Framework for New Features
| Criteria | Weight | Consideration |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| User Impact | 5 | How many users benefit? |
| Implementation Effort | 4 | Time and complexity |
| Strategic Alignment | 3 | Fits future vision? |
| Technical Risk | 3 | Likelihood of issues |
| Maintenance Cost | 2 | Long-term support needs |

Score features by multiplying weight by rating (1-5) and prioritize accordingly.
