# MVP Success Criteria

This document defines the minimum criteria for considering the Gaze Detection JavaScript application ready for initial testing and feedback. These criteria focus on essential functionality rather than completeness or optimization.

## MVP Launch Readiness Checklist

### 1. Functional Completeness
- [ ] **Core Application Flow**
  - [ ] Application launches successfully on target platform
  - [ ] User can see webcam feed in the main window
  - [ ] Face detection runs in real-time with visual indicators
  - [ ] Eye contact detection works with reasonable accuracy
  - [ ] User can start/stop the detection process

- [ ] **Data Handling**
  - [ ] Face detection results are processed correctly
  - [ ] Eye contact state is tracked consistently
  - [ ] Screenshots are captured when eye contact is detected
  - [ ] Images are saved with appropriate timestamps
  - [ ] Basic configuration is persisted between sessions

- [ ] **User Controls**
  - [ ] User can adjust detection sensitivity
  - [ ] User can select camera source (if multiple available)
  - [ ] User can specify screenshot save location
  - [ ] Basic help/information is available in the UI

### 2. "Good Enough" Quality
- [ ] **Performance**
  - [ ] Face detection runs at minimum 15 fps on target hardware
  - [ ] Application startup time is under 5 seconds
  - [ ] UI remains responsive during detection
  - [ ] Memory usage remains stable during extended use

- [ ] **Accuracy**
  - [ ] Eye contact detection has comparable accuracy to Python version
  - [ ] False positives are minimized with default settings
  - [ ] Detection works in typical lighting conditions
  - [ ] Basic detection works with users wearing glasses

- [ ] **Stability**
  - [ ] No crashes during normal application use
  - [ ] Application handles camera permission denial gracefully
  - [ ] Error states provide helpful information to users
  - [ ] Application recovers from temporary camera disconnection

- [ ] **User Experience**
  - [ ] UI clearly indicates system status at all times
  - [ ] Detection status is immediately visible
  - [ ] Controls are intuitive and properly labeled
  - [ ] Feedback is provided for user actions

### 3. Deployment Readiness
- [ ] **Packaging**
  - [ ] Application can be packaged for primary target platform
  - [ ] Package size is reasonable (under 100MB)
  - [ ] Application installs without errors
  - [ ] Dependencies are properly bundled

- [ ] **Documentation**
  - [ ] README explains basic application use
  - [ ] Installation instructions are clear and accurate
  - [ ] Known limitations are documented
  - [ ] License and attribution information is included

- [ ] **Feedback Mechanism**
  - [ ] Users can report issues (email or form)
  - [ ] Critical application errors are logged
  - [ ] Contact information is provided for support
  - [ ] Version information is clearly visible

- [ ] **Sustainability**
  - [ ] Code is organized for future development
  - [ ] Key components are documented
  - [ ] Technical debt is identified and documented
  - [ ] Path for future enhancements is clear

## Deferred to Post-MVP

The following items are explicitly deferred until after MVP feedback:

1. **Video recording** functionality
2. **Multiple face optimization**
3. **Advanced configuration options**
4. **Analytics and telemetry**
5. **Performance optimizations**
6. **Multiple window management**
7. **Advanced UI theming**
8. **Cross-platform testing** (focus on primary platform for MVP)

## Minimum Performance Targets

- **CPU usage:** < 50% on target hardware during normal operation
- **Memory usage:** < 500MB
- **Frame rate:** â‰¥ 15 fps for detection
- **Startup time:** < 5 seconds to fully operational
- **Detection latency:** < 200ms from eye contact to system recognition

These criteria represent the absolute minimum for MVP release. Meeting these criteria means the application is ready for initial user testing and feedback, but not necessarily for wide distribution or production use.
