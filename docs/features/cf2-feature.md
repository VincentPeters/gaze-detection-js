## 1. Purpose & Value
- **Goal:** Implement face detection and tracking capabilities using face-api.js
- **Value:** Provides the foundational computer vision capabilities required for eye contact detection
- **Success Criteria:** Application can detect and track faces in real-time with acceptable performance

## 2. Functional Requirements
- **Must Have:**
  - face-api.js integration with proper model loading
  - Real-time face detection in webcam feed
  - Basic face tracking across video frames
  - Face data model for storing detection results
  - Performance of at least 15fps on target hardware

- **Won't Have:**
  - Optimization for multiple faces (focus on single face for MVP)
  - Advanced facial landmarks analysis
  - Face recognition or identification
  - Detection history or analytics
  - Complex tracking algorithms

## 3. Implementation Tasks

### Task CF2-1: Integrate face-api.js Library
**Objective:** Add face-api.js to the project and set up model loading

**Starting Point:**
- Electron React application with webcam feed from previous features

**Done When:**
- face-api.js is properly installed as a dependency
- Models are loaded successfully at application startup
- Loading progress is communicated to the user
- Models are cached for subsequent loads

**Simplest Approach:**
- Install face-api.js via npm
- Load only the essential models (face detection and basic landmarks)
- Use a simple loading indicator during initialization
- Store models in a local directory to avoid repeated downloads

### Task CF2-2: Implement Basic Face Detection
**Objective:** Detect faces in the webcam feed using face-api.js

**Starting Point:**
- Application with face-api.js integrated

**Done When:**
- Application can detect faces in the webcam feed
- Detection results include bounding boxes
- Performance is at least 15fps on target hardware
- Detection confidence threshold is configurable

**Simplest Approach:**
- Use SSD Mobilenet V1 model for best performance
- Process frames at an appropriate interval (not every frame)
- Implement simple rectangular indicators for detected faces
- Focus on stability rather than precision

### Task CF2-3: Create Face Tracking Functionality
**Objective:** Maintain consistent tracking of faces across video frames

**Starting Point:**
- Application with basic face detection

**Done When:**
- Faces maintain consistent identification across frames
- Tracking works even if detection temporarily fails
- Face IDs remain stable during normal use
- Tracking information is accessible to other components

**Simplest Approach:**
- Implement simple tracking based on bounding box overlap
- For MVP, optimize for single face scenario
- Use basic interpolation for missed frames
- Track only essential attributes (position, size)

### Task CF2-4: Define Face Data Model and State Management
**Objective:** Create a structured data model for storing face detection and tracking information

**Starting Point:**
- Application with face detection and tracking

**Done When:**
- Face data model is clearly defined
- Detection results are stored in appropriate state
- Data is accessible to other components
- State updates trigger appropriate UI refreshes

**Simplest Approach:**
- Create a minimal data model with essential properties
- Use React context for application-wide state
- Focus on functional updates rather than class-based structures
- Keep data structure flat for simplicity

## 4. Basic Testing Approach
- **Manual Test:** Run application, verify faces are detected and tracked when moving in frame
- **Edge Cases:** 
  - Test detection with glasses, different lighting conditions
  - Verify performance remains acceptable with continuous use
  - Test behavior when faces move in and out of frame

## 5. Dependencies
- **Required Before:** 
  - MS1 (Essential Environment)
  - MS2 (Critical Scaffolding) 
  - CF1 (User Journey Skeleton)
  
- **Enables:** 
  - CF3 (Critical Business Logic - eye contact detection)
  - LL2 (Deployment Minimum - screenshot capture)
