## Task CF2-1: Integrate face-api.js Library [ ]

### Status
- [x] Not Started
- [ ] In Progress
- [ ] Complete
- [ ] Verified

### Objective
Add face-api.js to the project and set up model loading and initialization for face detection capabilities.

### Starting Point
- Electron React application with camera feed
- Basic application structure from MS1 and MS2

### Done When
- face-api.js is properly installed as a dependency
- Models are loaded successfully at application startup
- Loading progress is communicated to the user
- Models are cached for subsequent loads
- Appropriate models are selected for performance
- Error handling for model loading failures is implemented
- Model initialization does not block the UI
- Simple test confirms face-api.js is functioning

### Implementation Guidelines
- Install face-api.js and configure it:
  ```javascript
  // Install
  npm install --save face-api.js
  
  // Import and configure
  import * as faceapi from 'face-api.js';
  
  // Set models path
  const MODEL_URL = './assets/models';
  ```

- Load the essential models:
  ```javascript
  async function loadModels(progressCallback) {
    try {
      // Start with SSD MobileNet for best performance
      await faceapi.nets.ssdMobilenetv1.loadFromUri(MODEL_URL, progressCallback);
      
      // Load facial landmark model for eye region detection
      await faceapi.nets.faceLandmark68Net.loadFromUri(MODEL_URL, progressCallback);
      
      return true;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error loading face-api models:', error);
      return false;
    }
  }
  ```

- Create model loading utility:
  - Implement progress tracking
  - Add model caching mechanism
  - Handle network or file access errors
  - Support retry mechanisms

- Implement model loading UI:
  - Progress indicator with percentage
  - Status messages for each model
  - Error display with retry option
  - Loading overlay during initialization

- Set up model configuration:
  - Configure detection parameters
  - Set appropriate minimum confidence
  - Configure performance options
  - Create detection utilities

- Handle model files:
  - Download and include all necessary model files
  - Organize models in assets directory
  - Ensure correct paths in packaged app
  - Add clear documentation

- Common pitfalls to avoid:
  - Loading too many models unnecessarily
  - Blocking UI thread during model loading
  - Not providing feedback during long loads
  - Neglecting error handling for model loading

### Dependencies
- Requires completion of MS1 and MS2
- Internet connection for initial model downloads
- Maximum time box: 5 hours
