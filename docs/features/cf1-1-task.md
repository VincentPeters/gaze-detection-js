## Task CF1-1: Implement Camera Feed Display [ ]

### Status
- [x] Not Started
- [ ] In Progress
- [ ] Complete
- [ ] Verified

### Objective
Create a component that displays the webcam feed in the main application window with proper sizing, positioning, and controls.

### Starting Point
- Basic Electron/React application with webcam access
- Directory structure and component architecture

### Done When
- Camera feed is displayed in the main window
- Feed is properly sized and positioned
- Feed updates in real-time with smooth framerate
- Camera selection is possible if multiple cameras detected
- User can start/stop the camera feed
- Error states are handled (no camera, permission denied)
- Display includes visual indicators for camera status
- Performance is acceptable with minimal CPU usage

### Implementation Guidelines
- Create a CameraFeed component:
  ```jsx
  function CameraFeed({ deviceId, onFrame }) {
    const videoRef = useRef(null);
    const [status, setStatus] = useState('inactive');
    const [error, setError] = useState(null);
    
    // Start camera, handle errors, etc.
    // ...
    
    return (
      <div className="camera-feed">
        <div className="camera-status">{status}</div>
        {error && <div className="camera-error">{error}</div>}
        <video 
          ref={videoRef} 
          autoPlay 
          playsInline 
          muted
        />
        <div className="camera-controls">
          {/* Start/stop buttons, camera selector */}
        </div>
      </div>
    );
  }
  ```

- Implement camera device selection:
  - Enumerate available video devices
  - Create dropdown or list for selection
  - Store selected device in configuration
  - Handle device changes properly

- Add error handling for common scenarios:
  - No camera available
  - Permission denied
  - Camera disconnected
  - Camera in use by another application

- Optimize performance:
  - Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth rendering
  - Consider throttling frame processing
  - Implement proper cleanup to avoid memory leaks
  - Use appropriate video resolution

- Add styling:
  - Proper aspect ratio for video
  - Responsive sizing within container
  - Clear visual states (active, inactive, error)
  - Simple controls with intuitive icons/labels

- Common pitfalls to avoid:
  - Memory leaks from unmanaged video streams
  - Performance issues from excessive re-renders
  - Poor error communication to users
  - Neglecting proper resource cleanup

### Dependencies
- Requires completion of MS1 and MS2 tasks
- Maximum time box: 5 hours
