# Feature EN4: Preset Management

## 1. Objective and Scope
- **Primary Goal:** Implement a system for saving, loading, and managing configuration presets, allowing users to switch between different application configurations easily.
- **User/System Value:** Enables users to save and recall optimized configurations for different environments, use cases, or artistic intentions, greatly enhancing usability and flexibility.
- **Feature Boundaries:** 
  - In scope: Preset data structure, preset saving functionality, preset loading system, preset organization, default preset definitions.
  - Out of scope: Cloud synchronization of presets, sharing presets between installations, automatic preset optimization.
- **Relationship to Project Goals:** Preset management enhances the usability and flexibility of the eye contact detection application, allowing it to be quickly reconfigured for different artistic or research purposes.

## 2. Functional Requirements
- **Key Capabilities:**
  - Save the current configuration as a named preset
  - Load configuration from saved presets
  - Manage (rename, delete, duplicate) existing presets
  - Include metadata with presets (description, date, author)
  - Provide default presets for common scenarios
  - Import and export presets for sharing

- **User Interactions:**
  - Users should be able to save the current configuration as a preset
  - Users should be able to load configuration from a preset
  - Users should be able to manage (edit, delete, etc.) presets
  - Users should be able to view preset metadata
  - Users should be able to import and export presets

- **System Interactions:**
  - The system should save presets to persistent storage
  - The system should load and apply presets correctly
  - The system should validate presets before applying them
  - The system should provide preset management capabilities

- **Expected Outcomes:**
  - A fully functional preset management system
  - Efficient storage and organization of presets
  - Reliable loading and application of preset configurations
  - User-friendly preset management interface

## 3. Technical Approach
- **Architectural Considerations:**
  - Preset data structure and format
  - Storage mechanism for presets
  - Validation of preset data
  - Integration with configuration system
  - Backward compatibility with older preset formats

- **Technology Options:**
  - Storage formats: JSON, YAML, custom format
  - Storage mechanisms: local files, Electron Store
  - Validation approaches: schema validation, runtime checking

- **Integration Points:**
  - With configuration system for saving/loading settings
  - With UI components for preset management interface
  - With file system for import/export functionality
  - With validation system for ensuring preset integrity

- **Scalability Considerations:**
  - Handling growing number of presets
  - Performance with large preset files
  - Compatibility with evolving configuration options
  - Organization of presets for improved usability

## 4. Implementation Tasks
Break down into outcome-oriented tasks that describe WHAT to accomplish, not HOW:

### Task EN4-1: Preset Data Structure Definition
**Objective:** Define a comprehensive data structure for configuration presets, including metadata.

**Full details in task file:** `/docs/features/EN4/feature_task_1.md`

### Task EN4-2: Preset Saving Functionality
**Objective:** Implement the ability to save current configuration as a named preset.

**Full details in task file:** `/docs/features/EN4/feature_task_2.md`

### Task EN4-3: Preset Loading System
**Objective:** Create a system for loading and applying configuration from saved presets.

**Full details in task file:** `/docs/features/EN4/feature_task_3.md`

### Task EN4-4: Preset Management Capabilities
**Objective:** Develop functionality for managing presets, including renaming, deleting, and duplicating.

**Full details in task file:** `/docs/features/EN4/feature_task_4.md`

### Task EN4-5: Preset Import/Export System
**Objective:** Implement functionality for importing and exporting presets for sharing.

**Full details in task file:** `/docs/features/EN4/feature_task_5.md`

## 5. Interaction & Behavior Specifications
- **User Flow Diagrams:**
  ```
  Configure Application -> Save as Preset -> Name Preset -> Add Description -> Confirm Save
  
  Select Preset -> Preview Settings -> Load Preset -> Configuration Applied
  
  Browse Presets -> Select Preset -> Manage Preset (Rename/Delete/Duplicate) -> Confirm Action
  ```

- **System Behavior Descriptions:**
  - When a user saves a preset, the current configuration should be captured and stored
  - When a user loads a preset, the configuration should be applied system-wide
  - When a preset is modified, the changes should be stored persistently
  - When the application is installed, default presets should be available
  - When configuration options change across versions, presets should be migrated if possible

- **State Transitions:**
  - From current configuration to saved preset
  - From preset data to applied configuration
  - From one preset to another
  - From unmodified preset to modified preset
  - From temporary import to permanent preset

- **Error Scenarios:**
  - Invalid preset data during loading
  - Storage access issues during saving
  - Conflicts between preset and current system capabilities
  - Incompatible preset format versions
  - Preset management operation failures

## 6. Testing Verification
- **Verification Approach:**
  - Unit testing of preset operations
  - Integration testing with configuration system
  - Validation testing with various preset scenarios
  - User interface testing for preset management

- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Saving and loading presets
  - Importing and exporting presets
  - Managing presets through the UI
  - Handling invalid or corrupted presets
  - Backward compatibility with older preset formats

- **Success Indicators:**
  - Presets are saved and loaded correctly
  - Preset management operations work as expected
  - Invalid presets are handled gracefully
  - Default presets are available and functional
  - Preset operations have appropriate performance

- **Edge Cases:**
  - Very large preset files
  - Presets with obsolete configuration options
  - Rapid switching between presets
  - Presets with extreme parameter values
  - Concurrent access to preset storage
