# Feature EN3: Log System Implementation

## 1. Objective and Scope
- **Primary Goal:** Create a logging system that records application events, errors, and operational data for debugging and monitoring purposes.
- **User/System Value:** Provides crucial information for troubleshooting, understanding system behavior, and monitoring application performance over time.
- **Feature Boundaries:** 
  - In scope: Logging framework, event categorization, log display interface, log file management, error and warning handling.
  - Out of scope: Advanced analytics on log data, automated error recovery, remote logging services integration.
- **Relationship to Project Goals:** A comprehensive logging system enhances the maintainability and reliability of the eye contact detection application, facilitating both development and deployment.

## 2. Functional Requirements
- **Key Capabilities:**
  - Log various types of application events (info, warning, error, debug)
  - Categorize log events by component and severity
  - Store logs in structured format for later analysis
  - Display real-time log information in the application
  - Configure logging verbosity and storage
  - Manage log file sizes and rotation

- **User Interactions:**
  - Users should be able to view logs in the application
  - Users should be able to filter logs by category and severity
  - Users should be able to configure logging behavior
  - Users should be able to export logs for sharing

- **System Interactions:**
  - The system should log events from all application components
  - The system should write logs to persistent storage
  - The system should manage log file size and rotation
  - The system should provide log data to the UI when requested

- **Expected Outcomes:**
  - A comprehensive logging system capturing all significant application events
  - Efficient storage and management of log data
  - User-friendly log display and filtering capabilities
  - Configurable logging behavior to suit different needs

## 3. Technical Approach
- **Architectural Considerations:**
  - Centralized vs. component-based logging
  - Synchronous vs. asynchronous logging
  - Log storage format and structure
  - Performance impact of verbose logging
  - Integration with existing error handling mechanisms

- **Technology Options:**
  - Logging libraries: Winston, Bunyan, simple-node-logger
  - Storage formats: JSON, plain text, structured formats
  - Rotation strategies: Size-based, time-based, or hybrid
  - Display options: Custom UI, integrated console, file viewers

- **Integration Points:**
  - With all application components for event capture
  - With error handling system for error reporting
  - With UI system for log display
  - With configuration system for log settings

- **Scalability Considerations:**
  - Performance impact during intensive logging
  - Storage requirements for long-term logging
  - Handling of high-volume log events
  - Search and retrieval efficiency for large log sets

## 4. Implementation Tasks
Break down into outcome-oriented tasks that describe WHAT to accomplish, not HOW:

### Task EN3-1: Logging Framework Implementation
**Objective:** Create a core logging framework to capture and process application events.

**Full details in task file:** `/docs/features/EN3/feature_task_1.md`

### Task EN3-2: Log Categorization System
**Objective:** Develop a system for categorizing log events by component, severity, and type.

**Full details in task file:** `/docs/features/EN3/feature_task_2.md`

### Task EN3-3: Log Storage and Management
**Objective:** Implement log file storage, rotation, and management capabilities.

**Full details in task file:** `/docs/features/EN3/feature_task_3.md`

### Task EN3-4: Log Display Interface
**Objective:** Create a user interface for viewing, filtering, and analyzing log data.

**Full details in task file:** `/docs/features/EN3/feature_task_4.md`

### Task EN3-5: Logging Configuration System
**Objective:** Develop configurable logging settings with runtime adjustment capabilities.

**Full details in task file:** `/docs/features/EN3/feature_task_5.md`

## 5. Interaction & Behavior Specifications
- **User Flow Diagrams:**
  ```
  Application Operation -> Events Generated -> Events Logged -> Logs Stored -> Logs Displayed (if requested)
  
  User Opens Log Panel -> View Logs -> Apply Filters -> Export Logs (if needed)
  ```

- **System Behavior Descriptions:**
  - When an application event occurs, it should be captured by the logging system
  - When a log is captured, it should be categorized and stored appropriately
  - When log storage reaches capacity, rotation should occur automatically
  - When the log display is accessed, logs should be retrieved and displayed efficiently
  - When log filters are applied, only matching entries should be displayed

- **State Transitions:**
  - From event occurrence to log creation
  - From log creation to storage
  - From log query to display
  - From unfiltered logs to filtered view
  - From file rotation trigger to new log file

- **Error Scenarios:**
  - Logging system initialization failures
  - Storage access issues during logging
  - Log corruption or format issues
  - Excessive log volume impacting performance
  - Log rotation failures

## 6. Testing Verification
- **Verification Approach:**
  - Unit testing of logging components
  - Integration testing with application systems
  - Performance testing under high log volume
  - Log integrity verification

- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Normal operation logging
  - Error condition logging
  - High-volume logging performance
  - Log rotation and management
  - Log display and filtering functionality

- **Success Indicators:**
  - All significant application events are properly logged
  - Logs are stored efficiently and reliably
  - Log rotation operates without data loss
  - Log display and filtering work correctly
  - Logging has minimal impact on application performance

- **Edge Cases:**
  - Extremely high-volume logging situations
  - Storage constraints during logging
  - Concurrent log access from multiple components
  - Very large log files
  - System crashes during logging operations
