## Task MS2-2: Install Essential Dependencies [ ]

### Status
- [x] Not Started
- [ ] In Progress
- [ ] Complete
- [ ] Verified

### Objective
Add all core dependencies needed for MVP functionality and configure them appropriately for the project.

### Starting Point
- Basic Electron/React application with directory structure
- Minimal dependencies from initial setup

### Done When
- All required dependencies are installed and properly configured:
  - face-api.js for face detection
  - TensorFlow.js for running the eye contact model
  - State management solution (React Context or minimal Redux)
  - File system access utilities
  - Basic UI components
- Dependencies are documented with purpose in README
- Package.json is clean and organized
- Development dependencies are properly categorized
- Dependency versions are fixed for stability
- Package-lock.json or yarn.lock is committed

### Implementation Guidelines
- Install core ML/detection dependencies:
  ```
  npm install --save face-api.js @tensorflow/tfjs
  ```

- Install state management:
  ```
  # For minimal approach with React Context - no additional dependencies needed
  # OR for Redux approach
  npm install --save redux react-redux redux-thunk
  ```

- Install UI utilities:
  ```
  npm install --save classnames
  ```

- Configure face-api.js:
  - Add model paths configuration
  - Set up detection parameters
  - Create utility for model loading

- Configure TensorFlow.js:
  - Set appropriate backend (WebGL preferred)
  - Configure memory management
  - Create model loading utilities

- Document dependencies in README:
  - List each major dependency with purpose
  - Note any configuration requirements
  - Include links to official documentation

- For dependency management:
  - Fix versions to specific releases (not ranges)
  - Organize dependencies alphabetically
  - Separate dev dependencies appropriately
  - Document any peer dependency requirements

- Common pitfalls to avoid:
  - Installing unused or redundant packages
  - Using multiple packages with overlapping functionality
  - Overengineering dependency management
  - Using unstable/deprecated packages

### Dependencies
- Requires completion of MS2-1 (Directory Structure)
- Internet connection for package downloads
- Maximum time box: 4 hours
