## Task MS1-2: Integrate React for UI Development [ ]

### Status
- [x] Not Started
- [ ] In Progress
- [ ] Complete
- [ ] Verified

### Objective
Add React to the Electron renderer process to enable component-based UI development with modern JavaScript features.

### Starting Point
- Basic Electron application from Task MS1-1
- Empty or placeholder renderer process

### Done When
- React is properly integrated with Electron renderer
- React renders in the Electron window
- Hot reloading works for UI development
- Basic component structure is established
- Sample component demonstrates React functionality
- Development environment supports JSX and modern JS features
- Build process correctly bundles React code for production

### Implementation Guidelines
- For a webpack-based approach:
  1. Install React dependencies:
     ```
     npm install --save react react-dom
     npm install --save-dev @babel/core @babel/preset-react babel-loader
     ```
  2. Configure webpack to handle React:
     - Add appropriate loaders for JSX
     - Configure babel presets for React
     - Set up dev server with hot reloading

- For a Create React App approach:
  1. Set up separate CRA project in renderer directory
  2. Configure electron-forge to use CRA for the renderer
  3. Ensure proper IPC bridge between main and renderer

- Create minimal CSS setup (just enough to display content properly)
- Set up a simple component hierarchy:
  - App (root component)
  - Layout (basic page structure)
  - Placeholder for camera component

- Focus on functional components with hooks rather than class components
- Implement basic error boundaries for React rendering

- Common pitfalls to avoid:
  - Over-complex component structure at this stage
  - Adding state management libraries prematurely
  - Configuring unnecessary React features/optimizations
  - Mixing different styling approaches

### Dependencies
- Requires successful completion of Task MS1-1
- Node.js and npm with access to React packages
- Maximum time box: 4 hours
