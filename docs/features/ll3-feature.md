# Feature LL3: Rapid Iteration Plan [ ]

## Progress
- [ ] Requirements Defined
- [ ] Tasks Created
- [ ] Implementation Started
- [ ] Testing Complete
- [ ] Feature Complete

## 1. Purpose & Value
- **Goal:** Establish a framework for collecting user feedback and rapidly improving the application post-MVP
- **Value:** Ensures continuous improvement based on real user experiences and needs
- **Success Criteria:** Team can effectively collect, prioritize, and implement improvements based on user feedback

## 2. Functional Requirements
- **Must Have:**
  - Feedback collection mechanism for users
  - Issue prioritization framework
  - Future feature roadmap process
  - Development process documentation
  - Rapid response implementation plan

- **Won't Have:**
  - Analytics dashboard
  - Automated feedback analysis
  - Detailed long-term planning
  - Comprehensive project management system
  - Complex metrics tracking

## 3. Implementation Tasks

### Task LL3-1: Implement Feedback Collection Mechanism
**Objective:** Create a simple way for users to provide feedback about the application

**Starting Point:**
- Deployed application ready for user testing

**Done When:**
- Users can submit feedback directly from the application
- Feedback includes:
  - Issue description
  - Category selection
  - Impact assessment
  - Optional contact information
- Feedback is delivered to development team (email or issue tracker)
- Submission includes basic system information

**Simplest Approach:**
- Create a simple form within the application
- Send feedback via email or API to issue tracker
- Include minimal required fields
- Provide clear guidance on what feedback is helpful

### Task LL3-2: Create Issue Prioritization Framework
**Objective:** Develop a system for categorizing and prioritizing reported issues and enhancement requests

**Starting Point:**
- Feedback collection mechanism

**Done When:**
- Framework defines:
  - Issue categories (bug, enhancement, etc.)
  - Priority levels with clear criteria
  - Impact assessment guidelines
  - Assignment process
  - Target response times by priority
- Framework is documented for team use

**Simplest Approach:**
- Create a simple prioritization matrix
- Define 3-4 priority levels with clear criteria
- Focus on user impact as primary factor
- Keep process lightweight and adjustable

### Task LL3-3: Develop Future Feature Roadmap
**Objective:** Establish a process for planning post-MVP feature development

**Starting Point:**
- MVP feature set and initial user feedback

**Done When:**
- Initial post-MVP feature roadmap is created
- Process for updating roadmap is documented
- Criteria for feature selection are defined
- Timeboxes for feature cycles are established
- Dependencies between features are identified

**Simplest Approach:**
- Create a simple feature backlog
- Group features into logical enhancement cycles
- Prioritize based on user value and implementation effort
- Allow for adjustment based on feedback
- Keep planning horizons short (1-2 months)

### Task LL3-4: Document Development Process
**Objective:** Create clear documentation for ongoing development

**Starting Point:**
- Working development processes from MVP creation

**Done When:**
- Documentation covers:
  - Development environment setup
  - Code standards and patterns
  - Branch and PR process
  - Testing requirements
  - Release procedures
- Documentation is accessible to all team members
- Process supports rapid iteration cycles

**Simplest Approach:**
- Document the process actually used, not theoretical ideal
- Focus on removing friction from development workflow
- Keep requirements minimal but clear
- Emphasize automation where possible
- Allow for process evolution

## 4. Basic Testing Approach
- **Manual Test:** 
  - Test feedback submission process
  - Verify prioritization framework with sample issues
  - Review roadmap with stakeholders
  - Validate development process with team members

- **Edge Cases:** 
  - Test feedback with no network connection (should queue)
  - Verify process handles conflicting priorities
  - Check framework with unusual feature requests
  - Test process with different team member roles

## 5. Dependencies
- **Required Before:**
  - LL1 (Basic Testing)
  - LL2 (Deployment Minimum)
  
- **Enables:**
  - Post-MVP development cycles
  - Long-term project sustainability
