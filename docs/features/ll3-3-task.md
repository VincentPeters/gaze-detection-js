  ```

- Develop feature evaluation matrix:
  - Create scoring system for feature evaluation
  - Define key dimensions (impact, effort, strategy, risk)
  - Create template for feature proposals
  - Implement visual roadmap for planning

- Establish roadmap update process:
  - Define review frequency and participants
  - Create feedback collection for roadmap items
  - Establish update communication channels
  - Document process for adding/removing features

- Create initial feature backlog:
  - List all deferred MVP features
  - Add anticipated user needs
  - Include technical improvements
  - Prioritize using established criteria

- Implement roadmap visualization:
  - Create timeline view of planned features
  - Show dependencies between features
  - Highlight key milestones
  - Make accessible to team members

- Common pitfalls to avoid:
  - Overcommitting to specific dates far in advance
  - Not accounting for maintenance and bug fixing time
  - Ignoring user feedback in favor of predetermined plans
  - Creating a rigid roadmap that can't adapt to changing needs

### Dependencies
- Requires complete MVP feature set
- Input from LL3-1 (Feedback Collection) helpful but not required
- Maximum time box: 6 hours
