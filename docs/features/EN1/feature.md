# Feature EN1: Media Capture System

## 1. Objective and Scope
- **Primary Goal:** Implement a system for capturing screenshots and recording videos when eye contact is detected, including file management and storage.
- **User/System Value:** Provides the essential functionality for documenting moments of eye contact, which is a primary purpose of the application for artistic and interactive installations.
- **Feature Boundaries:** 
  - In scope: Screenshot capture functionality, video recording system, file naming and organization, capture trigger mechanism, media storage management.
  - Out of scope: Media editing, advanced file formats, media playback, cloud storage integration.
- **Relationship to Project Goals:** Media capture is a key output feature of the eye contact detection application, allowing it to preserve moments of eye contact for artistic, research, or documentary purposes.

## 2. Functional Requirements
- **Key Capabilities:**
  - Capture high-quality screenshots when eye contact is detected
  - Record video clips during periods of eye contact
  - Generate appropriate file names with timestamps and identifiers
  - Organize captured media in a structured file system
  - Manage storage space and prevent excessive usage
  - Implement configurable capture settings (resolution, format, frequency)

- **User Interactions:**
  - Users should be able to configure media capture settings
  - Users should be notified when media is captured
  - Users should be able to access captured media easily
  - Users should be able to enable/disable media capture

- **System Interactions:**
  - The system should trigger media capture based on eye contact detection
  - The system should save media files to the specified location
  - The system should manage file naming and organization
  - The system should monitor and manage storage usage

- **Expected Outcomes:**
  - Reliable and high-quality media capture when eye contact is detected
  - Well-organized storage of captured media
  - Efficient management of system resources during capture
  - Configurable capture behavior to suit different use cases

## 3. Technical Approach
- **Architectural Considerations:**
  - Integration with eye contact detection triggers
  - Performance impact of media capture operations
  - Storage management and organization
  - File format and quality considerations
  - Thread/process management for non-blocking capture

- **Technology Options:**
  - Screenshot Capture: Canvas API, Electron's desktopCapturer
  - Video Recording: MediaRecorder API, ffmpeg integration
  - File Management: Node.js fs module via Electron
  - Storage Monitoring: Electron API, Node.js disk utilities

- **Integration Points:**
  - With eye contact detection for capture triggering
  - With multi-face tracking for per-face capture
  - With configuration system for capture settings
  - With file system for storage and organization

- **Scalability Considerations:**
  - Performance impact during continuous operation
  - Storage growth over time
  - Handling multiple simultaneous capture events
  - Resource management during intensive capture periods

## 4. Implementation Tasks
Break down into outcome-oriented tasks that describe WHAT to accomplish, not HOW:

### Task EN1-1: Screenshot Capture Implementation
**Objective:** Create functionality for capturing high-quality screenshots when eye contact is detected.

**Full details in task file:** `/docs/features/EN1/feature_task_1.md`

### Task EN1-2: Video Recording System
**Objective:** Implement a system for recording video clips during periods of eye contact.

**Full details in task file:** `/docs/features/EN1/feature_task_2.md`

### Task EN1-3: File Management and Organization
**Objective:** Develop a structure for naming, organizing, and managing captured media files.

**Full details in task file:** `/docs/features/EN1/feature_task_3.md`

### Task EN1-4: Capture Trigger Mechanism
**Objective:** Create a system for triggering media capture based on eye contact detection events.

**Full details in task file:** `/docs/features/EN1/feature_task_4.md`

### Task EN1-5: Storage Management
**Objective:** Implement monitoring and management of storage usage for captured media.

**Full details in task file:** `/docs/features/EN1/feature_task_5.md`

## 5. Interaction & Behavior Specifications
- **User Flow Diagrams:**
  ```
  Eye Contact Detected -> Trigger Media Capture -> Capture Screenshot/Start Recording -> Process Media -> Save to Storage -> Notify User
  
  User Configures Capture Settings -> Settings Updated -> Capture Behavior Changes
  ```

- **System Behavior Descriptions:**
  - When eye contact is detected, the system should evaluate capture triggers
  - When a capture is triggered, the system should capture a screenshot or start video recording
  - When a video recording is in progress, the system should monitor eye contact state
  - When eye contact ends, the system should stop recording after a configurable delay
  - When media is captured, it should be saved with appropriate metadata
  - When storage usage exceeds thresholds, the system should notify the user

- **State Transitions:**
  - From eye contact detection to media capture
  - From capture initiation to completed save
  - From idle to recording state
  - From recording to saved state
  - From normal operation to storage management

- **Error Scenarios:**
  - Capture failure due to resource constraints
  - Storage full during capture
  - File system access restrictions
  - Concurrent capture conflicts
  - Media processing errors

## 6. Testing Verification
- **Verification Approach:**
  - Functional testing of capture capabilities
  - Performance testing during continuous operation
  - Storage management testing
  - Integration testing with eye contact detection

- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Screenshot capture quality and performance
  - Video recording functionality and quality
  - File naming and organization
  - Trigger mechanism reliability
  - Storage management effectiveness

- **Success Indicators:**
  - Reliable capture of media when eye contact is detected
  - High-quality screenshot and video output
  - Proper file organization and naming
  - Efficient storage management
  - Minimal performance impact on core detection features

- **Edge Cases:**
  - Very brief eye contact events
  - Rapidly alternating eye contact states
  - Extremely long eye contact periods
  - Multiple simultaneous capture events
  - Very low storage situations
