## 1. Purpose & Value
- **Goal:** Establish minimal testing procedures to verify that the MVP functions correctly and reliably
- **Value:** Ensures the application delivers its core value proposition without major issues
- **Success Criteria:** Critical user flows are verified, major edge cases are tested, and performance meets minimum requirements

## 2. Functional Requirements
- **Must Have:**
  - Manual test flow documentation for core functionality
  - Detection accuracy verification procedures
  - Performance assessment methodology
  - Issue tracking system for found problems
  - Basic regression testing approach

- **Won't Have:**
  - Automated testing suite
  - Comprehensive test coverage
  - Performance benchmarking tool
  - Complex test management system
  - Beta testing program

## 3. Implementation Tasks

### Task LL1-1: Create Manual Test Flow Documentation
**Objective:** Document step-by-step procedures for testing all critical application functions

**Starting Point:**
- Functional application with core features implemented

**Done When:**
- Test procedures are documented for:
  - Application startup and initialization
  - Camera access and display
  - Face detection functionality
  - Eye contact detection
  - Screenshot capture
  - Configuration management
- Tests include expected outcomes
- Documentation is clear enough for non-developers to follow

**Simplest Approach:**
- Create simple markdown documents with steps
- Include screenshots for clarity
- Focus on the most critical paths first
- Use a checklist format for easy verification

### Task LL1-2: Implement Detection Accuracy Verification
**Objective:** Establish methods to verify eye contact detection accuracy

**Starting Point:**
- Functional application with eye contact detection

**Done When:**
- Procedure exists to compare detection accuracy with Python version
- Test scenarios are defined for various conditions
- Verification includes tests with glasses, different lighting, etc.
- Minimum accuracy thresholds are established

**Simplest Approach:**
- Create a simple set of standard test scenarios
- Document expected outcomes for each scenario
- Use basic metrics (true positives, false positives)
- Compare with original Python version when possible

### Task LL1-3: Perform Performance Assessment
**Objective:** Measure and document application performance metrics

**Starting Point:**
- Functional application with all core features

**Done When:**
- Key performance metrics are identified and measured:
  - FPS for video and detection
  - CPU usage during operation
  - Memory consumption
  - Startup time
  - Detection latency
- Performance meets minimum thresholds
- Major bottlenecks are identified

**Simplest Approach:**
- Use built-in developer tools for measurement
- Focus on user-perceivable performance issues
- Document baseline performance on reference hardware
- Identify only the most critical optimizations needed

### Task LL1-4: Establish Issue Tracking Process
**Objective:** Create a simple system for tracking and prioritizing issues found during testing

**Starting Point:**
- Test procedures and initial testing results

**Done When:**
- Issue tracking system is in place (GitHub Issues or similar)
- Issue template includes critical information
- Severity/priority system is defined
- Process for tracking fixes is established
- Major issues from testing are documented

**Simplest Approach:**
- Use GitHub Issues or a simple spreadsheet
- Create minimal issue template with key fields
- Define 3-4 priority levels at most
- Focus on tracking only significant issues

## 4. Basic Testing Approach
- **Manual Test:** Execute all test procedures, document results, and verify that testing processes themselves work as expected
- **Edge Cases:** 
  - Test with various hardware configurations
  - Try deliberately incorrect configurations
  - Test boundary conditions for detection thresholds
  - Verify behavior with resource constraints

## 5. Dependencies
- **Required Before:**
  - CF1 (User Journey Skeleton)
  - CF2 (Data Essentials)
  - CF3 (Critical Business Logic)
  
- **Enables:**
  - LL2 (Deployment Minimum)
  - LL3 (Rapid Iteration Plan)
