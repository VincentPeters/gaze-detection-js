# Feature CF3: Eye Contact Model Conversion

## 1. Objective and Scope
- **Primary Goal:** Convert the existing PyTorch-based eye contact detection model to TensorFlow.js format and integrate it into the application to determine eye contact probability.

- **Feature Boundaries:** 
  - In scope: Model conversion pipeline, TensorFlow.js integration, eye contact detection implementation, model loading and initialization, detection parameter configuration.
  - Out of scope: Training new models, UI components, multi-face tracking, media capture triggered by eye contact.

## 5. Interaction & Behavior Specifications
- **User Flow Diagrams:**
  ```
  Application Launch -> Load Eye Contact Model -> Model Ready -> Face Detected -> Process Face Region -> Determine Eye Contact -> Provide Result
  
  User Adjusts Detection Parameters -> Parameters Updated -> Detection Behavior Changes -> New Results Displayed
  ```

- **System Behavior Descriptions:**
  - When the application starts, it should load the eye contact detection model
  - When a face is detected, its region should be processed by the model
  - When the model processes a face region, it should return an eye contact probability
  - When the probability exceeds the configured threshold, eye contact should be registered
  - When detection parameters are adjusted, the detection behavior should update accordingly

- **State Transitions:**
  - From model loading to ready state
  - From face detection to eye contact determination
  - From no eye contact to eye contact detected
  - From one set of detection parameters to another

- **Error Scenarios:**
  - Model loading or initialization failures
  - Incompatible input data format
  - Performance degradation affecting real-time capability
  - Inconsistent detection results
  - Resource constraints affecting model execution
