## Task MS1-3: Add Webcam Access Capabilities [ ]

### Status
- [x] Not Started
- [ ] In Progress
- [ ] Complete
- [ ] Verified

### Objective
Enable access to the webcam for video capture in the Electron application and display the video feed in a React component.

### Starting Point
- Electron application with React integration from Task MS1-2
- No existing camera access code

### Done When
- Application can request and receive webcam permissions
- Video feed can be displayed in a React component
- Feed can be started and stopped via user controls
- Application handles permission denial gracefully
- Camera component correctly releases resources when unmounted
- User receives appropriate feedback during camera initialization
- Multiple cameras can be detected (if available)
- Basic error states are handled and communicated to user

### Implementation Guidelines
- Use the browser's MediaDevices API for webcam access:
  ```javascript
  async function getVideoStream() {
    try {
      const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
        video: {
          width: { ideal: 1280 },
          height: { ideal: 720 }
        }
      });
      return stream;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error accessing camera:', error);
      // Handle errors appropriately
    }
  }
  ```

- Create a reusable React component for video display:
  - Request camera access on mount
  - Display the video feed in a video element
  - Provide controls for starting/stopping
  - Release camera resources on unmount

- Implement proper error handling for common scenarios:
  - Permission denied
  - No camera available
  - Camera disconnected
  - Camera in use by another application

- For proper resource management:
  - Track active stream in component state
  - Properly stop all tracks when component unmounts
  - Handle window/document visibility changes

- Add basic styling for the video component:
  - Appropriate sizing and aspect ratio
  - Visual indicators for camera state
  - Loading/error states with user feedback

- Common pitfalls to avoid:
  - Not handling permission denial or errors properly
  - Memory leaks from not cleaning up video streams
  - Attempting to access camera before the DOM is ready
  - Hard-coding camera constraints

### Dependencies
- Requires completion of Task MS1-2 (React Integration)
- System with working webcam for testing
- Maximum time box: 4 hours
