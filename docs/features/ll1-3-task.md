## Task LL1-3: Perform Performance Assessment [ ]

### Status
- [x] Not Started
- [ ] In Progress
- [ ] Complete
- [ ] Verified

### Objective
Measure and document application performance metrics to ensure the application meets minimum requirements and identify potential optimization targets.

### Starting Point
- Functional application with all core features
- No formal performance measurements

### Done When
- Key performance metrics are identified and measured:
  - FPS for video and detection
  - CPU usage during operation
  - Memory consumption
  - Startup time
  - Detection latency
- Performance meets minimum thresholds
- Major bottlenecks are identified and documented
- Performance is measured on reference hardware
- Baseline performance is established for future comparison
- Performance impact of different configurations is understood
- Documentation of performance results is complete

### Implementation Guidelines
- Develop performance measurement methodology:
  ```markdown
  # Performance Assessment Protocol
  
  ## Test Environment
  
  **Reference Hardware:**
  - CPU: [specify minimum target CPU]
  - RAM: [specify minimum RAM]
  - OS: [specify supported OS versions]
  - Browser/Runtime: Electron [version]
  
  **Test Conditions:**
  - Clean system start (no other applications running)
  - Standard 720p webcam
  - Single face in frame during testing
  - Room temperature operation
  
  ## Metrics and Targets
  
  | Metric | Measurement Method | Target | Minimum Acceptable |
  |--------|-------------------|--------|-------------------|
  | Startup Time | Time from launch to ready state | < 3 seconds | < 5 seconds |
  | Detection FPS | Frames processed per second | > 20 FPS | > 15 FPS |
  | CPU Usage | Task Manager / Activity Monitor | < 30% | < 50% |
  | Memory Usage | Task Manager / Activity Monitor | < 300MB | < 500MB |
  | Detection Latency | Time from eye contact to detection | < 100ms | < 200ms |
  
  ## Measurement Procedures
  
  ### Startup Time Measurement
  1. Ensure application is not running
  2. Start timer
  3. Launch application
  4. Stop timer when UI is responsive and camera is active
  5. Record result
  6. Repeat 5 times and calculate average
  ```

- Implement performance monitoring in the application:
  ```javascript
  class PerformanceMonitor {
    constructor() {
      this.metrics = {
        fps: 0,
        detectionTime: 0,
        frameProcessingTime: 0,
        memoryUsage: 0,
        startupTime: 0
      };
      this.frameCount = 0;
      this.lastFrameTime = 0;
      this.startTime = performance.now();
      
      // For Electron, we can access process info
      this.processMemory = process.memoryUsage;
    }
    
    startFrame() {
      this.lastFrameTime = performance.now();
      return this.lastFrameTime;
    }
    
    endFrame() {
      const now = performance.now();
      const frameDuration = now - this.lastFrameTime;
      
      this.frameCount++;
      this.metrics.frameProcessingTime = 
        (this.metrics.frameProcessingTime * 0.9) + (frameDuration * 0.1);
      
      // Calculate FPS over 1-second window
      if (now - this.startTime >= 1000) {
        this.metrics.fps = this.frameCount;
        this.frameCount = 0;
        this.startTime = now;
        
        // Update memory usage
        if (this.processMemory) {
          const memory = this.processMemory();
          this.metrics.memoryUsage = memory.heapUsed / 1024 / 1024; // MB
        }
      }
      
      return this.metrics;
    }
    
    recordDetectionTime(duration) {
      this.metrics.detectionTime = 
        (this.metrics.detectionTime * 0.9) + (duration * 0.1);
    }
    
    getMetrics() {
      return { ...this.metrics };
    }
  }
  ```

- Conduct performance testing:
  - Basic usage scenarios
  - Stress testing with multiple faces
  - Extended duration testing
  - Testing with different configuration values
  - Measurement with developer tools

- Analyze performance bottlenecks:
  - Profiling with Chrome DevTools
  - JavaScript CPU profiling
  - Memory usage analysis
  - GPU utilization monitoring
  - Frame timing breakdown

- Document optimization opportunities:
  - High-impact bottlenecks
  - Configuration tuning recommendations
  - Hardware requirement adjustments
  - Potential code optimizations
  - Feature adjustments for performance

- Common pitfalls to avoid:
  - Measuring under inconsistent conditions
  - Not accounting for warmup time
  - Ignoring memory growth over time
  - Testing only on development hardware
  - Focusing on micro-optimizations

### Dependencies
- Requires functional application with all core features
- Maximum time box: 6 hours
