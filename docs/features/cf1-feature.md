## 1. Purpose & Value
- **Goal:** Create the minimal viable user interface and interaction flow to support the core eye contact detection functionality
- **Value:** Provides the interface through which users interact with the application's core value proposition
- **Success Criteria:** Users can see the camera feed, understand when eye contact is detected, and control basic application functions

## 2. Functional Requirements
- **Must Have:**
  - Camera feed display in the main application window
  - Basic application layout with intuitive organization
  - Simple controls for starting/stopping detection
  - Visual feedback elements for application state
  - Area for detection status display

- **Won't Have:**
  - Advanced UI with multiple panels or windows
  - Complex animations or transitions
  - Multiple theme support
  - Responsive design for various screen sizes
  - Advanced customization options

## 3. Implementation Tasks

### Task CF1-1: Implement Camera Feed Display
**Objective:** Create a component that displays the webcam feed in the main application window

**Starting Point:**
- Basic Electron/React application with webcam access

**Done When:**
- Camera feed is displayed in the main window
- Feed is properly sized and positioned
- Feed updates in real-time (smooth framerate)
- Camera selection is available if multiple cameras detected

**Simplest Approach:**
- Use the video element with getUserMedia results
- Create a simple container with fixed dimensions
- Implement basic error states for camera issues
- Focus on stability rather than visual polish

### Task CF1-2: Create Basic Application Layout
**Objective:** Design and implement a simple, intuitive layout for the application UI

**Starting Point:**
- Application with camera feed component

**Done When:**
- Main application regions are defined (feed, controls, status)
- Layout is clean and functional
- Critical UI elements are easily accessible
- Layout supports all planned interaction elements

**Simplest Approach:**
- Use a simple grid or flexbox layout
- Focus on functional organization over aesthetics
- Keep the design minimal and focused
- Use sensible spacing and sizing conventions

### Task CF1-3: Implement Control Elements
**Objective:** Create the essential controls for starting, stopping, and configuring the detection

**Starting Point:**
- Application with camera feed and basic layout

**Done When:**
- Start/stop controls for detection are implemented
- Basic configuration controls are available
- Controls have appropriate visual states (enabled/disabled)
- Control actions properly affect application state

**Simplest Approach:**
- Use standard buttons and form elements
- Implement only the most essential controls
- Use clear, concise labels
- Provide simple visual feedback for actions

### Task CF1-4: Create Status and Feedback Elements
**Objective:** Implement visual elements to communicate application state and detection results

**Starting Point:**
- Application with camera feed, layout, and controls

**Done When:**
- Application state is clearly visible (running, stopped, loading)
- Detection status can be displayed
- Feedback is immediate and clear
- Critical errors are communicated effectively

**Simplest Approach:**
- Use simple status indicators (colors, icons)
- Implement minimal text feedback
- Focus on clarity over sophistication
- Ensure visibility in various lighting conditions

## 4. Basic Testing Approach
- **Manual Test:** 
  - Verify camera feed displays properly
  - Test all control elements function as expected
  - Confirm status indicators show appropriate states
  - Check UI works with different window sizes

- **Edge Cases:** 
  - Test with camera permission denied
  - Verify behavior when camera is disconnected
  - Check display on different monitor sizes/resolutions
  - Test with different camera resolutions

## 5. Dependencies
- **Required Before:**
  - MS1 (Essential Environment)
  - MS2 (Critical Scaffolding)
  
- **Enables:**
  - CF2 (Data Essentials - visualization of detection)
  - CF3 (Critical Business Logic - display of detection results)
  - LL2 (Deployment Minimum - screenshot interface)
