# Task MS2-4: State Management Architecture (DONE)

## Objective
Define the approach for managing application state across components and windows, creating a coherent system for state storage, updates, and synchronization throughout the application.

## Starting Context
The application needs a structured approach to manage state across different processes and components. This is essential for maintaining consistency and enabling proper communication between the main and renderer processes.

## Expected Outcome
A well-defined state management architecture that:
- Provides a single source of truth for application state
- Enables state sharing between processes
- Supports React component state management
- Includes persistence for relevant state
- Handles state synchronization efficiently

## Implementation Details

### State Organization
- Created a comprehensive state architecture document in `docs/architecture/state-management.md`
- Organized state into domains: application, camera, detection, and media capture

### Main Process State Management
- Implemented a centralized state store in `src/main/state/store.js`
- Added support for state validation, persistence, and synchronization
- Created IPC handlers for state operations

### Renderer Process State Management
- Implemented React hooks for accessing state in `src/renderer/state/useAppState.js`
- Created domain-specific hooks for camera, detection, and media state
- Developed a context provider system in `src/renderer/state/StateProvider.jsx`

### Cross-Process Synchronization
- Used the IPC framework for state synchronization between processes
- Implemented selective updates to minimize IPC traffic
- Added support for subscribing to state changes

### State Persistence
- Added functionality to save and load state from disk
- Implemented serialization for complex state objects
- Created mechanisms for state recovery

### Integration
- Updated the main process entry point to initialize the state store
- Enhanced the renderer entry point to use the state provider
- Updated the App component to use the state context

## Verification Approach
- Manual testing of state synchronization between processes
- Verification of state persistence across application restarts
- Confirmation that components can access and update state correctly

## Decision Guidance
- Used a domain-based organization for clear separation of concerns
- Implemented a React Context-based approach for renderer state
- Chose a centralized store pattern for main process state
- Used selective synchronization to optimize performance

## Dependencies
- Electron's IPC mechanisms for cross-process communication
- React Context API for component state management
- File system for state persistence

## Effort Estimation
- Medium-high effort (3-4 days)
- Requires careful design and implementation to ensure consistency

## Risk Factors
- State synchronization issues between processes
- Performance impact of excessive state updates
- Complexity in debugging state-related issues
