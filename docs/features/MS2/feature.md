# Feature MS2: Project Structure & Architecture

## 1. Objective and Scope
- **Primary Goal:** Define and implement the core application architecture, project structure, and communication patterns between different components of the eye contact detection system.
- **User/System Value:** Provides a solid foundation that enables modular development, maintainability, and scalability of the application.
- **Feature Boundaries:**
  - In scope: Project directory structure, architectural patterns, module organization, inter-process communication, state management approach.
  - Out of scope: Specific implementation details of individual features, UI design, business logic implementation.
- **Relationship to Project Goals:** A well-designed architecture ensures that the JavaScript refactoring will be maintainable, extensible, and perform efficiently while supporting all the required functionality of the original Python application.

## 2. Functional Requirements
- **Key Capabilities:**
  - Support separation between Electron's main and renderer processes
  - Enable efficient communication between processes and components
  - Facilitate state management across multiple windows
  - Support modular organization of code for maintainability
  - Enable clear separation of concerns between different system components
  - Provide patterns for handling asynchronous operations

- **User Interactions:**
  - Developers should be able to understand the system architecture easily
  - Code organization should be intuitive and follow established patterns
  - Components should interact with each other through well-defined interfaces

- **System Interactions:**
  - Main process should manage window creation and system resources
  - Renderer processes should handle UI and user interactions
  - Inter-process communication should be efficient and reliable
  - State should be managed consistently across the application

- **Expected Outcomes:**
  - A clearly defined project structure that follows best practices
  - Well-documented architectural patterns for the application
  - Established communication patterns between components
  - A foundation that supports all required application features

## 3. Technical Approach
- **Architectural Considerations:**
  - Balance between performance and maintainability
  - Separation of concerns between system components
  - Error handling and recovery mechanisms
  - Adaptability to changing requirements
  - Support for multi-window operations

- **Technology Options:**
  - State Management: React Context, Redux, MobX
  - IPC Mechanisms: Electron IPC, Context Bridge
  - Module Systems: ES Modules, CommonJS
  - Directory Structure: Feature-based, Layer-based, or Hybrid

- **Integration Points:**
  - Between main and renderer processes
  - Between different renderer processes (windows)
  - Between UI components and business logic
  - Between the application and system resources

- **Scalability Considerations:**
  - Architecture should support addition of new features
  - Project structure should remain manageable as codebase grows
  - Performance should not degrade with increased functionality
  - State management should handle increased complexity

## 4. Implementation Tasks
Break down into outcome-oriented tasks that describe WHAT to accomplish, not HOW:

### Task MS2-1: Project Directory Structure Definition (DONE)
Define the directory structure for the project, including main and renderer process code organization, assets, and configuration files.

### Task MS2-2: Main and Renderer Process Architecture (DONE)
Define the architecture and responsibility boundaries between Electron's main and renderer processes.

### Task MS2-3: Inter-Process Communication Framework (DONE)
Establish a framework for communication between main and renderer processes that follows Electron's security best practices.

### Task MS2-4: State Management Architecture (DONE)
Define the state management approach for the application, including how state is shared between processes.

### Task MS2-5: Module and Component Organization (DONE)
Establish patterns for organizing reusable modules and components within the application, creating a consistent structure that promotes code reuse, maintainability, and clear dependencies.

### Task MS2-6: Build and Packaging Configuration
Set up the build and packaging configuration for the application, including development and production builds

## 5. Interaction & Behavior Specifications
- **User Flow Diagrams:**
  ```
  User Action in UI -> UI Component -> State Update -> Business Logic -> IPC Message -> Main Process -> System Resource Access -> Response -> State Update -> UI Update
  ```

- **System Behavior Descriptions:**
  - When the application starts, the main process should initialize core services
  - When a new window is requested, the main process should create it and establish communication channels
  - When state changes in one component, other dependent components should be updated accordingly
  - When async operations complete, the system should handle results or errors appropriately

- **State Transitions:**
  - From application launch to initialized system
  - From user action to system response
  - From one window's state change to synchronized state across windows
  - From system event to appropriate application response

- **Error Scenarios:**
  - Process crashes should be contained and not affect other processes
  - Communication failures between processes should be detected and handled
  - State inconsistencies should be prevented or resolved
  - Unexpected system conditions should be handled gracefully

## 6. Testing Verification
- **Verification Approach:**
  - Code review of architectural implementation
  - Prototype testing of key architectural patterns
  - Verification of communication between different processes
  - State management testing across different scenarios

- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Communication between main and renderer processes
  - State synchronization across multiple windows
  - Error handling in different architectural layers
  - Performance under various loads and conditions

- **Success Indicators:**
  - Clear separation of concerns between different components
  - Effective communication between processes
  - Consistent state management across the application
  - Maintainable code organization that follows established patterns

- **Edge Cases:**
  - Handling of race conditions in asynchronous operations
  - Dealing with unexpected process termination
  - Managing state when windows are created or destroyed dynamically
  - Handling system resource constraints
