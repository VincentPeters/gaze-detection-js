# Task MS2-2: Main and Renderer Process Architecture (DONE)

## Objective
Define the architecture and responsibility boundaries between Electron's main process and renderer processes, establishing a clear separation of concerns and communication patterns.

## Starting Context
- **System State:**
  - Development environment has been set up (MS1)
  - Project directory structure has been defined (MS2-1)
  - No formal process architecture exists yet
- **Available Resources:**
  - Electron documentation on process model
  - Original Python application architecture for reference
  - Best practices for Electron application design
- **Constraints:**
  - Must follow Electron security best practices
  - Must support multiple renderer processes (windows)
  - Must enable efficient process communication
  - Must separate UI concerns from system operations

## Expected Outcome
- **Functional Result:** A well-defined architecture that clearly separates responsibilities between main and renderer processes and establishes communication patterns.
- **System Changes:**
  - Main process responsibilities and structure defined
  - Renderer process responsibilities and structure defined
  - Process initialization and lifecycle management established
  - Communication boundaries and interfaces specified
- **Observable Indicators:**
  - Architecture documentation clearly defines process responsibilities
  - Directory structure reflects the process separation
  - Entry points for both processes are established
  - Security boundaries between processes are maintained

## Interaction Specification
- **Input Handling:**
  - Main process should handle system events and commands
  - Renderer processes should handle user interactions
  - Process communication channels should be clearly defined
- **Output Generation:**
  - Main process should manage system resources and windows
  - Renderer processes should generate UI and visual output
  - Architecture documentation should specify responsibility for outputs
- **Error Handling:**
  - Process crash recovery strategies should be defined
  - Error propagation between processes should be specified
  - Error boundaries should be established
- **State Changes:**
  - Between process initialization sequences
  - During inter-process communication
  - When processes are created or destroyed
  - During application startup and shutdown

## Verification Approach
- **Manual Verification Steps:**
  - Review architecture documentation for completeness
  - Verify alignment with Electron best practices
  - Check that security boundaries are maintained
  - Ensure scalability for multiple renderer processes
- **Automated Test Approach:**
  - Define process boundary tests
  - Implement process communication verification
  - Create process lifecycle tests
- **Integration Check Points:**
  - Ensure compatibility with project directory structure
  - Verify alignment with planned IPC framework
  - Check compatibility with state management approach
  - Confirm support for multiple windows/processes

## Decision Guidance
- **Key Decisions:**
  - Responsibility division between processes
  - Process initialization approach
  - Process lifecycle management
  - Process security boundaries
  - Error handling across process boundaries
- **Consideration Factors:**
  - Security implications of process architecture
  - Performance considerations
  - Developer experience and clarity
  - Future maintainability
  - Alignment with Electron best practices
- **Tradeoff Analysis:**
  - Strict process isolation: Better security vs. communication overhead
  - Complex main process: Centralized control vs. potential bottlenecks
  - Multiple renderer processes: Better isolation vs. increased resource usage
  - Shared code: Reduced duplication vs. potential security issues
  - Preload scripts: Better security vs. increased complexity

## Dependencies
- **Preceding Tasks:**
  - MS1: Environment Setup (all subtasks)
  - MS2-1: Project Directory Structure Definition
- **Following Tasks:**
  - MS2-3: Inter-Process Communication Framework
  - MS3-1: Main Application Window Implementation
  - MS3-2: Window Management System
- **External Dependencies:**
  - Electron framework
  - Node.js security model
  - Operating system process management

## Effort Estimation
- **Complexity Assessment:** High
- **Skill Areas:**
  - Electron process architecture
  - Application security
  - Node.js/JavaScript architecture
  - Desktop application design
  - Process communication patterns
- **Risk Factors:**
  - Security vulnerabilities if not designed properly
  - Performance bottlenecks in process communication
  - Complex debugging across process boundaries
  - Potential for race conditions or deadlocks
  - Process isolation challenges with shared resources

## Implementation Notes
- Created comprehensive architecture documentation in `docs/architecture/process-architecture.md`
- Implemented main process entry point with clear separation of concerns
- Enhanced preload script with secure IPC communication
- Implemented window management with support for multiple windows
- Created shared types and constants for consistent communication
- Added basic logger utility for cross-process logging
- Implemented renderer process entry point with React integration
- Established clear boundaries between processes following Electron security best practices
