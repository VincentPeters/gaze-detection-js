# Task MS2-3: Inter-Process Communication Framework

## Objective
Establish a framework for communication between main and renderer processes, and between multiple renderer processes, ensuring secure, efficient, and reliable data exchange throughout the application.

## Starting Context
- **System State:** 
  - Development environment has been set up (MS1)
  - Project directory structure has been defined (MS2-1)
  - Main and renderer process architecture has been defined (MS2-2)
  - No formal IPC framework exists yet
- **Available Resources:** 
  - Electron IPC documentation
  - Original Python application communication patterns
  - Best practices for Electron IPC security
- **Constraints:** 
  - Must follow Electron security best practices (contextIsolation, etc.)
  - Must support bidirectional communication
  - Must enable communication between multiple renderer processes
  - Must be type-safe and predictable

## Expected Outcome
- **Functional Result:** A well-defined IPC framework that enables secure and efficient communication between all processes in the application.
- **System Changes:** 
  - IPC message types and formats defined
  - Communication channels established
  - Security measures implemented
  - Process isolation considerations addressed
  - Message handling patterns established
- **Observable Indicators:** 
  - IPC framework documentation is complete
  - Security boundaries are maintained
  - Message typing is clear and consistent
  - Communication patterns are well-defined

## Interaction Specification
- **Input Handling:** 
  - IPC messages should be validated and typed
  - Message receivers should handle messages predictably
  - Unexpected messages should be handled gracefully
  - Large data transfers should be optimized
- **Output Generation:** 
  - Message responses should be consistently formatted
  - Asynchronous responses should be properly managed
  - Error responses should be clear and informative
  - Broadcast messages should reach all intended recipients
- **Error Handling:** 
  - Communication failures should be detected and reported
  - Invalid messages should be rejected with meaningful errors
  - Timeout handling should be implemented
  - Recovery strategies for failed communications should be defined
- **State Changes:** 
  - During request-response cycles
  - When processes connect or disconnect
  - During application lifecycle events
  - When communication channels are established or closed

## Verification Approach
- **Manual Verification Steps:** 
  - Review IPC framework documentation for completeness
  - Verify alignment with Electron security best practices
  - Test basic communication patterns manually
  - Check error handling behavior
- **Automated Test Approach:** 
  - Create automated tests for IPC message handling
  - Implement stress tests for high-volume communication
  - Test error conditions and recovery
  - Verify security isolation
- **Integration Check Points:** 
  - Ensure compatibility with process architecture
  - Verify integration with window management system
  - Check support for all required message types
  - Confirm type safety across the communication boundary

## Decision Guidance
- **Key Decisions:** 
  - IPC pattern selection (request-response, pub-sub, etc.)
  - Message format and serialization approach
  - Security boundary implementation
  - Handling of large data transfers
  - Error and timeout handling strategies
- **Consideration Factors:** 
  - Security implications of IPC design
  - Performance characteristics of different approaches
  - Development experience and ease of use
  - Type safety and predictability
  - Alignment with Electron best practices
- **Tradeoff Analysis:** 
  - Strict validation: Better security vs. development overhead
  - Complex message typing: Better type safety vs. increased complexity
  - Preload scripts: Better security vs. more complex setup
  - Synchronous vs. asynchronous: Simplicity vs. non-blocking behavior
  - Centralized vs. distributed messaging: Better organization vs. potential bottlenecks

- **Preceding Tasks:** 
  - MS1: Environment Setup (all subtasks)
  - MS2-1: Project Directory Structure Definition
  - MS2-2: Main and Renderer Process Architecture
- **Following Tasks:** 
  - MS2-4: State Management Architecture
  - MS3-4: Inter-Window Communication
  - CF1-1: Camera Device Enumeration and Selection
- **External Dependencies:**

## Effort Estimation
- **Complexity Assessment:** High
- **Skill Areas:** 
  - Electron IPC patterns

  - Asynchronous programming
  - Type system design
  - Error handling
  - Process communication patterns
- **Risk Factors:**
