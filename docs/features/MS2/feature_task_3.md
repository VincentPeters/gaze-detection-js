# Task MS2-3: Inter-Process Communication Framework (DONE)

## Objective
Establish a framework for communication between main and renderer processes that follows Electron's security best practices.

## Starting Context
The application needs a secure and structured way for the main and renderer processes to communicate. This is essential for features like camera access, face detection, and window management.

## Expected Outcome
A well-defined IPC framework that:
- Follows Electron's security best practices
- Provides clear patterns for different types of communication (request-response, notifications)
- Includes validation and error handling
- Is extensible for future features

## Implementation Details

### IPC Architecture
- Created a comprehensive IPC architecture document in `docs/architecture/ipc-framework.md`
- Defined message structure, channel organization, and security considerations

### Shared IPC Components
- Implemented message utilities in `src/shared/ipc/message.js` for creating and validating messages
- Created a channel registry in `src/shared/ipc/channels.js` to manage all IPC channels with security levels

### Main Process IPC
- Implemented an IPC Manager in `src/main/ipc/ipcManager.js` to handle registration and validation
- Created domain-specific handlers in `src/main/ipc/handlers.js` for application, window, camera, and configuration

### Renderer Process IPC
- Implemented an IPC Client in `src/renderer/ipc/ipcClient.js` for sending requests and subscribing to notifications
- Updated the preload script to expose secure IPC APIs to the renderer

### Security Features
- Implemented channel whitelisting based on security levels (public, protected, private)
- Added sender/receiver validation to ensure only authorized processes can communicate
- Included message validation to prevent malformed messages

### Integration
- Updated the main process entry point to initialize the IPC framework
- Enhanced the window manager to work with the IPC framework
- Added logging for all IPC operations

## Verification Approach
- Manual testing of IPC communication between processes
- Verification of security boundaries
- Confirmation that all components follow the defined architecture

## Decision Guidance
- Used a structured message format with type, ID, channel, payload, sender, and receiver
- Implemented a registry pattern for managing channels and their security levels
- Chose a modular approach with separate managers for main and renderer processes

## Dependencies
- Electron's IPC mechanisms (ipcMain, ipcRenderer, contextBridge)
- Logger utility for debugging and monitoring

## Effort Estimation
- Medium-high effort (3-4 days)
- Requires careful design and implementation to ensure security

## Risk Factors
- Security vulnerabilities if not implemented correctly
- Performance impact if overused
- Complexity in debugging cross-process communication
