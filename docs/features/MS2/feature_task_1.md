# Task MS2-1: Project Directory Structure Definition

## Objective
Define and establish a clear, organized directory structure for the application code, creating a logical framework that enables efficient development, maintenance, and scalability.

## Starting Context
- **System State:** 
  - Development environment has been set up (MS1)
  - No formal project directory structure exists yet
- **Available Resources:** 
  - Electron and React best practices documentation
  - Original Python application structure for reference
  - Standard JavaScript/Node.js project patterns
- **Constraints:** 
  - Must support Electron's main and renderer process separation
  - Must accommodate React component organization
  - Must be maintainable as the project grows
  - Must be intuitive for developers to navigate

## Expected Outcome
- **Functional Result:** A well-defined project directory structure that logically organizes code, assets, and configuration.
- **System Changes:** 
  - Root project directory structure established
  - Main process and renderer process directories defined
  - Supporting directories for assets, utilities, and configuration created
  - README and documentation structure defined
- **Observable Indicators:** 
  - Directories exist and follow a consistent naming pattern
  - Placeholder files or README files explain directory purposes
  - Structure enables clear import/require paths
  - Organization matches architectural documentation

## Interaction Specification
- **Input Handling:** 
  - Directory structure should support efficient module imports
  - Structure should facilitate clear separation of concerns
  - Paths should be consistent across the application
- **Output Generation:** 
  - Directory structure should be created in the filesystem
  - Documentation should describe the purpose of each directory
  - Sample or template files may be included where appropriate
- **Error Handling:** 
  - Naming conflicts should be avoided
  - Deep nesting should be minimized to prevent path length issues
  - Platform-specific path issues should be considered
- **State Changes:** 
  - From unstructured project to organized directory structure
  - From ad-hoc organization to standardized pattern
  - From development-focused structure to a structure that supports both development and production

## Verification Approach
- **Manual Verification Steps:** 
  - Verify all required directories exist
  - Check that directory names follow the defined convention
  - Ensure documentation accurately describes the structure
  - Test creating a simple component or module in the structure
- **Automated Test Approach:** 
  - Create scripts to verify directory existence and structure
  - Add linting rules to enforce import path conventions
  - Implement structure validation in the build process
- **Integration Check Points:** 
  - Ensure structure supports Electron main and renderer processes
  - Verify React component organization is accommodated
  - Check that build system can work with the defined structure
  - Confirm test frameworks can locate files appropriately

## Decision Guidance
- **Key Decisions:** 
  - Overall directory organization approach
  - Naming conventions for directories and files
  - Separation strategy for different application concerns
  - Asset and resource organization
  - Configuration file locations
- **Consideration Factors:** 
  - Development workflow efficiency
  - Build system compatibility
  - Long-term maintainability
  - Team familiarity with patterns
  - Scalability as the project grows
- **Tradeoff Analysis:** 
  - Flat structure: Simpler navigation vs. less organization
  - Feature-based organization: Clear boundaries vs. potential duplication
  - Type-based organization: Clear categorization vs. scattered features
  - Deep nesting: Clear hierarchy vs. long import paths
  - Strict conventions: Consistency vs. flexibility

## Dependencies
- **Preceding Tasks:** 
  - MS1: Environment Setup (all subtasks)
- **Following Tasks:** 
  - MS2-2: Main and Renderer Process Architecture
  - MS2-3: Inter-Process Communication Framework
  - MS2-4: State Management Architecture
  - MS2-5: Module and Component Organization
- **External Dependencies:** 
  - File system access
  - Version control system integration

## Effort Estimation
- **Complexity Assessment:** Low
- **Skill Areas:** 
  - JavaScript/Node.js project organization
  - Electron application architecture
  - React component organization
  - Project management
  - Developer experience optimization
- **Risk Factors:** 
  - Potential future reorganization needs
  - Team adoption of conventions
  - Cross-platform path compatibility
  - Integration with build system expectations
