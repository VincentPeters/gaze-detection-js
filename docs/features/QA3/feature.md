# Feature QA3: Error Handling & Recovery

## 1. Objective and Scope
- **Primary Goal:** Implement comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms to ensure the application remains stable and functional even when encountering unexpected conditions.
- **User/System Value:** Provides resilience and reliability, improving user experience by preventing crashes and data loss while enabling graceful degradation of functionality when issues occur.
- **Feature Boundaries:** 
  - In scope: Error detection system, recovery mechanisms, graceful degradation approach, user notification system, critical error handling.
  - Out of scope: Automatic bug reporting to developers, automatic updates to fix errors, prevention of all possible errors.
- **Relationship to Project Goals:** Error handling and recovery is essential for creating a robust eye contact detection application that can operate reliably in various environments and handle unexpected situations gracefully.

## 2. Functional Requirements
- **Key Capabilities:**
  - Detect and categorize different types of errors
  - Implement recovery strategies for various error scenarios
  - Provide graceful degradation when full functionality cannot be maintained
  - Notify users appropriately about errors and recovery actions
  - Log detailed error information for troubleshooting
  - Preserve application state during error recovery when possible

- **User Interactions:**
  - Users should receive clear notifications about errors
  - Users should understand what functionality is affected by errors
  - Users should be presented with recovery options when applicable
  - Users should experience minimal disruption from non-critical errors

- **System Interactions:**
  - The system should detect errors in various components
  - The system should attempt recovery from errors when possible
  - The system should maintain partial functionality when complete recovery is not possible
  - The system should log detailed error information
  - The system should prevent cascading failures

- **Expected Outcomes:**
  - Robust application that handles errors gracefully
  - Clear user communication about error states
  - Effective recovery from common error conditions
  - Detailed logging for troubleshooting and improvement
  - Prevention of complete application failures where possible

## 3. Technical Approach
- **Architectural Considerations:**
  - Error boundary and containment strategies
  - State preservation during error recovery
  - Hierarchical error handling approach
  - Balance between automatic recovery and user intervention
  - Error prioritization and categorization

- **Technology Options:**
  - Exception Handling: try/catch patterns, Promise error handling
  - React Error Boundaries for UI components
  - Electron process isolation for containment
  - State management approaches for recovery
  - Logging and diagnostics tools

- **Integration Points:**
  - With logging system for error recording
  - With UI components for error notifications
  - With state management for preservation and recovery
  - With configuration system for error handling settings
  - With all functional components for error detection

- **Scalability Considerations:**
  - Handling errors under high load conditions
  - Managing multiple simultaneous errors
  - Error handling performance impact
  - Recovery prioritization when resources are limited

## 4. Implementation Tasks
Break down into outcome-oriented tasks that describe WHAT to accomplish, not HOW:

### Task QA3-1: Error Detection and Categorization
**Objective:** Create a system for detecting and categorizing different types of errors across the application.

**Full details in task file:** `/docs/features/QA3/feature_task_1.md`

### Task QA3-2: Recovery Strategy Implementation
**Objective:** Develop recovery strategies for different error categories and scenarios.

**Full details in task file:** `/docs/features/QA3/feature_task_2.md`

### Task QA3-3: Graceful Degradation System
**Objective:** Implement approaches for maintaining partial functionality when full recovery is not possible.

**Full details in task file:** `/docs/features/QA3/feature_task_3.md`

### Task QA3-4: User Notification System
**Objective:** Create mechanisms for notifying users about errors and recovery actions.

**Full details in task file:** `/docs/features/QA3/feature_task_4.md`

### Task QA3-5: Critical Error Handling
**Objective:** Implement special handling for critical errors that could compromise system stability.

**Full details in task file:** `/docs/features/QA3/feature_task_5.md`

## 5. Interaction & Behavior Specifications
- **User Flow Diagrams:**
  ```
  Normal Operation -> Error Occurs -> Error Detected -> Recovery Attempted -> User Notified -> Normal Operation Resumed
  
  Normal Operation -> Critical Error Occurs -> Safe Mode Activated -> User Notified -> User Selects Recovery Option
  ```

- **System Behavior Descriptions:**
  - When a non-critical error occurs, the system should attempt automatic recovery
  - When recovery is successful, the system should resume normal operation
  - When full recovery is not possible, the system should degrade gracefully to maintain essential functionality
  - When a critical error occurs, the system should preserve state and prevent data loss
  - When users need to be notified, messages should be clear and actionable

- **State Transitions:**
  - From normal operation to error state
  - From error state to recovery process
  - From recovery process to normal operation
  - From full functionality to degraded functionality
  - From error state to application restart (if necessary)

- **Error Scenarios:**
  - Camera access failures
  - Face detection model errors
  - Eye contact model execution failures
  - File system access issues
  - Memory or resource exhaustion
  - Unexpected data formats or values
  - Component communication failures
  - External dependency failures

## 6. Testing Verification
- **Verification Approach:**
  - Error injection testing to simulate various failures
  - Recovery verification in different scenarios
  - User notification assessment
  - Degraded mode functionality testing
  - Critical error handling validation

- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Camera disconnection during operation
  - Model loading failures
  - Memory constraint simulation
  - File access permission issues
  - IPC communication interruptions
  - Unexpected input data handling
  - Multiple simultaneous error conditions

- **Success Indicators:**
  - Errors are detected and categorized correctly
  - Recovery mechanisms work as expected
  - Graceful degradation maintains essential functionality
  - User notifications are clear and helpful
  - Critical errors are handled without data loss
  - Application stability is maintained during error conditions

- **Edge Cases:**
  - Cascading errors across multiple components
  - Errors during startup or initialization
  - Errors during shutdown or cleanup
  - Resource exhaustion preventing recovery
  - Errors in the error handling system itself
  - Timing-related errors in asynchronous operations
