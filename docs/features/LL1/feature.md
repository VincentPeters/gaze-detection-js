# Feature LL1: Cross-platform Build System

## 1. Objective and Scope
- **Primary Goal:** Establish a build system that creates application packages for multiple platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux) while ensuring consistency and reliability.
- **User/System Value:** Enables distribution of the eye contact detection application across different operating systems, broadening accessibility and usability.
- **Feature Boundaries:** 
  - In scope: Electron build configuration, platform-specific build settings, asset bundling, dependency packaging, build automation scripts.
  - Out of scope: Installer customization, application signing, app store submission, continuous deployment.
- **Relationship to Project Goals:** A cross-platform build system supports the broad accessibility of the eye contact detection application, allowing it to be used across different operating systems and environments.

## 2. Functional Requirements
- **Key Capabilities:**
  - Configure and execute builds for Windows, macOS, and Linux
  - Package all required application assets and dependencies
  - Apply appropriate platform-specific settings and configurations
  - Generate consistent application behavior across platforms
  - Automate the build process with scripts or tools
  - Verify build output integrity and functionality

- **User Interactions:**
  - Developers should be able to trigger builds for specific platforms
  - Developers should receive clear feedback about build progress and results
  - Developers should be able to configure build parameters
  - End-users should receive properly packaged applications for their platform

- **System Interactions:**
  - The build system should interface with Electron's packaging tools
  - The build system should integrate with the application code and assets
  - The build system should manage dependencies appropriately
  - The build system should handle platform-specific requirements

- **Expected Outcomes:**
  - Reliable application builds for Windows, macOS, and Linux
  - Consistent application behavior across platforms
  - Efficient automation of the build process
  - Clear build output and verification capabilities

## 3. Technical Approach
- **Architectural Considerations:**
  - Build configuration management
  - Platform-specific customizations
  - Asset and dependency packaging
  - Build process automation
  - Output verification

- **Technology Options:**
  - Build Tools: Electron Builder, Electron Forge, Electron Packager
  - Configuration Management: JSON, JavaScript, YAML
  - Automation: npm scripts, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI
  - Testing: Spectron, Jest, manual verification

- **Integration Points:**
  - With application code and assets
  - With dependency management system
  - With version control system
  - With continuous integration pipelines

- **Scalability Considerations:**
  - Managing increasing build complexity
  - Handling growing number of assets and dependencies
  - Build performance optimization
  - Supporting additional platforms or configurations

## 4. Implementation Tasks
Break down into outcome-oriented tasks that describe WHAT to accomplish, not HOW:

### Task LL1-1: Build System Selection and Configuration
**Objective:** Select and configure the appropriate build system for Electron application packaging.

**Full details in task file:** `/docs/features/LL1/feature_task_1.md`

### Task LL1-2: Platform-specific Build Configuration
**Objective:** Define and implement build configurations specific to Windows, macOS, and Linux.

**Full details in task file:** `/docs/features/LL1/feature_task_2.md`

### Task LL1-3: Asset and Dependency Packaging
**Objective:** Implement proper packaging of application assets and dependencies in the build process.

**Full details in task file:** `/docs/features/LL1/feature_task_3.md`

### Task LL1-4: Build Automation Scripts
**Objective:** Create scripts for automating the build process across different platforms.

**Full details in task file:** `/docs/features/LL1/feature_task_4.md`

### Task LL1-5: Build Verification System
**Objective:** Develop methods for verifying the integrity and functionality of build outputs.

**Full details in task file:** `/docs/features/LL1/feature_task_5.md`

## 5. Interaction & Behavior Specifications
- **User Flow Diagrams:**
  ```
  Developer Initiates Build -> Configure Build Parameters -> Build Process Executes -> Build Progress Reported -> Output Generated -> Build Verified
  
  Developer Configures CI -> Code Committed -> CI Triggered -> Automated Build Process -> Build Artifacts Generated -> Verification Reports
  ```

- **System Behavior Descriptions:**
  - When a build is initiated, the system should select appropriate configuration
  - When building for a specific platform, platform-specific settings should be applied
  - When packaging assets, all required resources should be included
  - When the build completes, verification should be performed
  - When errors occur, clear feedback should be provided to developers

- **State Transitions:**
  - From development code to packaged application
  - From platform-agnostic code to platform-specific builds
  - From build initiation to completed artifacts
  - From unverified to verified build outputs
  - From manual to automated build processes

- **Error Scenarios:**
  - Build configuration errors
  - Missing dependencies or assets
  - Platform-specific compilation issues
  - Resource constraints during building
  - Verification failures post-build

## 6. Testing Verification
- **Verification Approach:**
  - Automated testing of build outputs
  - Manual verification on target platforms
  - Comparison of build artifacts against specifications
  - Cross-platform functionality testing

- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Building for each supported platform
  - Packaging of all required assets
  - Application startup on target platforms
  - Feature functionality across platforms
  - Build automation reliability

- **Success Indicators:**
  - Successful builds for all target platforms
  - Consistent application behavior across platforms
  - All required assets packaged correctly
  - Automated builds match manual builds
  - Clear reporting of build results

- **Edge Cases:**
  - Building on one platform for another
  - Handling of large assets or dependencies
  - Platform-specific quirks or limitations
  - Resource-intensive build processes
  - Unusual file paths or naming conventions
