# Feature FI1: Media Capture System

## 1. Objective and Scope

- **Primary Goal:** Implement the screenshot and video recording functionality that activates when eye contact is detected in the application.
  
- **User/System Value:** The media capture system records meaningful moments of interaction, creating artifacts that represent the connection between the viewer and the installation, which is the core artistic purpose of the application.
  
- **Feature Boundaries:** 
  - In scope: Screenshot capture, video recording, file management, capture triggers, media preview
  - Out of scope: Advanced media editing, sharing functionality, cloud storage
  
- **Relationship to Project Goals:** This feature directly implements a core capability of the original Python application in the new JavaScript environment, maintaining functional parity while potentially improving media quality and management.

## 2. Functional Requirements

- **Key Capabilities:**
  - Capture high-quality screenshots when eye contact is detected
  - Record video clips during sustained eye contact events
  - Implement file naming and organization for captured media
  - Create capture trigger logic based on eye contact detection
  - Provide basic preview functionality for captured media

- **User Interactions:**
  - Viewing captured media previews
  - Adjusting capture settings (quality, duration, etc.)
  - Accessing saved media files
  - Experiencing capture feedback during eye contact

- **System Interactions:**
  - Processing camera feed for media capture
  - Monitoring eye contact state to trigger captures
  - Writing files to the file system
  - Managing file organization and naming
  - Generating previews of captured media

- **Expected Outcomes:**
  - High-quality media captures during eye contact
  - Properly organized and named media files
  - Reliable capture triggering based on eye contact
  - Preview functionality for reviewing captures
  - Configurable capture parameters

## 3. Technical Approach

- **Architectural Considerations:**
  - Separation of capture logic from triggering conditions
  - Performance impact of media capture during detection
  - File system interaction architecture
  - Integration with eye contact detection events
  - Preview generation and management

- **Technology Options:**
  - Canvas API for screenshot capture
  - MediaRecorder API for video recording
  - Electron's fs module for file operations
  - Web Workers for off-main-thread processing
  - IndexedDB for temporary storage (if needed)

- **Integration Points:**
  - Eye contact detection from CF2
  - Camera feed component from CF3
  - Application state management from MS2
  - Future configuration system from FI2
  - File system access through Electron

- **Scalability Considerations:**
  - System should handle frequent captures
  - Storage management for extended use
  - Performance during simultaneous detection and recording
  - Multiple face capture scenarios
  - Various capture quality options

## 5. Interaction & Behavior Specifications

- **User Flow Diagrams:**
  ```
  Screenshot capture flow:
  [Eye Contact Detected] → [Capture Trigger] → [Screenshot Taken] → [File Saved] → [Preview Generated] → [Visual Feedback]
  
  Video recording flow:
  [Sustained Eye Contact] → [Recording Starts] → [Recording Status Indicator] → [Eye Contact Ends] → [Recording Stops] → [File Saved] → [Preview Generated]
  
  Media review flow:
  [User Opens Media Section] → [Previews Displayed] → [User Selects Media] → [Full View Displayed] → [Optional: File System Access]
  ```

- **System Behavior Descriptions:**
  - When eye contact is first detected, system should capture a screenshot
  - When eye contact is sustained, system should begin video recording
  - When eye contact ends, video recording should stop and save
  - When media is captured, appropriate visual feedback should be provided
  - When media is saved, it should follow consistent naming conventions

- **State Transitions:**
  - From eye contact detected to media capture
  - From recording inactive to active
  - From capture to file saving
  - From save completed to preview generation
  - From normal operation to media review

- **Error Scenarios:**
  - If file system access fails: Appropriate error with fallback storage
  - If media capture fails: Error logged with retry mechanism
  - If storage is limited: Warning with cleanup suggestions
  - If simultaneous captures needed: Queue system with prioritization
  - If preview generation fails: Default placeholder with retry option

## 6. Testing Verification

- **Verification Approach:**
  - Functional testing of capture mechanisms
  - Performance testing during capture
  - File system interaction testing
  - Media quality assessment
  - User experience testing for capture feedback

- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Capturing screenshots during eye contact
  - Recording videos of various durations
  - Testing with different camera resolutions
  - Verifying file naming and organization
  - Assessing system performance during capture
  - Testing preview functionality

- **Success Indicators:**
  - High-quality media captures
  - Consistent file organization
  - Reliable trigger timing
  - Minimal performance impact during capture
  - Functional preview system
  - Appropriate user feedback

- **Edge Cases:**
  - Very brief eye contact (capture timing)
  - Very long eye contact (file size management)
  - Rapid succession of eye contact events
  - Multiple faces making eye contact simultaneously
  - Limited storage space scenarios
  - High-resolution vs. low-resolution captures
