- [ ] Feature Complete

## 1. Purpose & Value
- **Goal:** Create the essential deployment capabilities needed to package and distribute the application for testing
- **Value:** Allows users to install and use the application without development environment
- **Success Criteria:** Application can be packaged, installed, and used by testers who aren't developers

## 2. Functional Requirements
- **Must Have:**
  - Screenshot capture on eye contact detection
  - Basic configuration storage between sessions
  - Application packaging for primary target platform
  - Simple installation process
  - Basic user documentation

- **Won't Have:**
  - Video recording capabilities
  - Cloud storage or sharing of media
  - Auto-update functionality
  - Multi-platform packaging
  - Complex installation options

## 3. Implementation Tasks

### Task LL2-1: Implement Screenshot Capture
**Objective:** Create functionality to capture and save screenshots when eye contact is detected

**Starting Point:**
- Working eye contact detection functionality

**Done When:**
- Screenshots are captured when eye contact is detected
- Images are saved to user-specified location
- Filenames include timestamps for identification
- Capture has configurable debounce to prevent duplicates
- User receives visual confirmation of capture

**Simplest Approach:**
- Use canvas to capture frames from video element
- Save images using Electron's file system access
- Implement simple debounce mechanism
- Provide minimal UI feedback on capture

### Task LL2-2: Implement Configuration Persistence
**Objective:** Ensure user configuration is properly saved and loaded between sessions

**Starting Point:**
- Working configuration system from MS2

**Done When:**
- Configuration is automatically saved when changed
- Settings persist between application restarts
- User configurations are stored in appropriate location
- Default configuration is used for missing settings

**Simplest Approach:**
- Use Electron Store for simple persistence
- Save only essential configuration
- Implement basic validation on load
- Provide sensible defaults for all settings

### Task LL2-3: Create Application Packaging
**Objective:** Configure build process to create installable packages for the target platform

**Starting Point:**
- Functional application with all core features

**Done When:**
- Application can be built into installable package
- Package includes all required dependencies
- Installation works on clean system
- Basic build documentation is created

**Simplest Approach:**
- Use electron-builder for packaging
- Target only the primary platform initially
- Include only essential assets
- Create minimal installer

### Task LL2-4: Create User Documentation
**Objective:** Develop simple, clear documentation for installation and basic use

**Starting Point:**
- Packaged application ready for distribution

**Done When:**
- README includes:
  - Installation instructions
  - Basic usage guide
  - Configuration options
  - Troubleshooting tips
  - Contact for support
- Documentation is accessible to non-technical users

**Simplest Approach:**
- Use markdown for simple formatting
- Include screenshots for clarity
- Focus on essential information only
- Write in clear, non-technical language
- Include only documented, working features

## 4. Basic Testing Approach
- **Manual Test:** 
  - Install application on clean system
  - Verify screenshot capture works with different settings
  - Check configuration persists correctly
  - Validate all documented features

- **Edge Cases:** 
  - Test with invalid configuration
  - Verify behavior with storage permission issues
  - Check installation on various OS versions
  - Test with minimal system resources

## 5. Dependencies
- **Required Before:**
  - CF3 (Critical Business Logic)
  - LL1 (Basic Testing)
  
- **Enables:**
  - LL3 (Rapid Iteration Plan)
  - Initial user testing
