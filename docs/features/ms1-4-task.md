## Task MS1-4: Configure Basic Development Workflow [ ]

### Status
- [x] Not Started
- [ ] In Progress
- [ ] Complete
- [ ] Verified

### Objective
Establish a streamlined development workflow with appropriate scripts, documentation, and tools to enable efficient development and iteration.

### Starting Point
- Electron React application with webcam access from previous tasks
- Basic project structure established

### Done When
- Development workflow is documented in README
- npm scripts are configured for common operations:
  - Start development server
  - Build application
  - Package application
  - Run linting
- Basic linting is set up (ESLint)
- Git hooks are configured for basic quality checks
- Project structure is documented
- Developer can make changes and see results quickly
- Development/production environment differences are handled

### Implementation Guidelines
- Configure scripts in package.json:
  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "start": "electron-forge start",
    "dev": "electron-forge start",
    "package": "electron-forge package",
    "make": "electron-forge make",
    "lint": "eslint --ext .js,.jsx .",
    "lint:fix": "eslint --ext .js,.jsx . --fix"
  }
  ```

- Set up ESLint for code quality:
  ```
  npm install --save-dev eslint eslint-plugin-react
  ```

- Configure ESLint with appropriate rules:
  - Focus on catching common errors
  - Don't be overly restrictive at this stage
  - Ensure compatibility with React

- Set up Git hooks using Husky (optional):
  ```
  npm install --save-dev husky lint-staged
  ```

- Create comprehensive README with:
  - Setup instructions
  - Development workflow
  - Project structure
  - Troubleshooting tips

- Document the development environment:
  - Node.js version requirements
  - Required global dependencies
  - Editor recommendations/plugins

- Implement environment-specific configuration:
  - Development vs production settings
  - Debug tools in development only
  - Appropriate error handling for each

- Common pitfalls to avoid:
  - Overly complex build processes at this stage
  - Too strict linting rules that slow down development
  - Insufficient documentation for new developers
  - Complex configuration management

### Dependencies
- Requires completion of Tasks MS1-1, MS1-2, and MS1-3
- Git repository initialized
- Maximum time box: 3 hours
