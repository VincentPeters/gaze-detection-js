## Task MS2-1: Create Application Directory Structure [ ]

### Status
- [x] Not Started
- [ ] In Progress
- [ ] Complete
- [ ] Verified

### Objective
Establish a clean, organized directory structure for the project that supports all planned features and makes development clear and consistent.

### Starting Point
- Basic Electron/React application from MS1
- Limited or ad-hoc directory structure

### Done When
- Complete directory structure is implemented with:
  - Main process code organization
  - Renderer process component hierarchy
  - Shared utilities directory
  - Configuration files location
  - Assets directory (including ML models)
  - Documentation location
- README documents the structure with explanations
- Empty placeholder files/components where needed
- Import/require paths are consistent and logical
- Structure allows for clean separation of concerns

### Implementation Guidelines
- Create a function-focused structure:
  ```
  /src
    /main              # Main process code
      index.js         # Entry point
      window.js        # Window management
      config.js        # Configuration management
    /renderer          # Renderer process code
      /components      # React components
        /camera        # Camera-related components
        /detection     # Detection visualization
        /config        # Configuration UI
        /common        # Shared UI components
      /hooks           # Custom React hooks
      /utils           # Renderer-specific utilities
      index.js         # Renderer entry point
    /shared            # Code shared between processes
      /models          # Face/eye detection models
      /utils           # Shared utilities
      /types           # Type definitions
  /assets              # Static assets
    /models            # ML model files
    /images            # Application images
  /config              # Configuration files
  /docs                # Documentation
  ```

- Keep structure shallow to avoid navigation complexity
- Use consistent naming conventions:
  - kebab-case for directories and files
  - PascalCase for React components
  - camelCase for JavaScript variables/functions

- Create README.md files in key directories explaining purpose
- Add placeholder index.js files in empty directories for structure
- Implement basic imports/exports between directories to validate structure

- Common pitfalls to avoid:
  - Overly nested directory structures
  - Inconsistent naming patterns
  - Mixed architectural patterns
  - Rigid structure that's difficult to modify

### Dependencies
- Requires completion of MS1 (Essential Environment)
