## Task LL1-1: Create Manual Test Flow Documentation [ ]

### Status
- [x] Not Started
- [ ] In Progress
- [ ] Complete
- [ ] Verified

### Objective
Document step-by-step procedures for testing all critical application functions to ensure consistent verification of functionality.

### Starting Point
- Functional application with core features implemented
- No existing test documentation

### Done When
- Test procedures are documented for all key functionality:
  - Application startup and initialization
  - Camera access and display
  - Face detection functionality
  - Eye contact detection
  - Screenshot capture
  - Configuration management
- Tests include expected outcomes and success criteria
- Test cases cover key user journeys
- Documentation is clear enough for non-developers to follow
- Test flows are organized in logical sequence
- Important edge cases are covered

### Implementation Guidelines
- Create a structured test documentation:
  ```markdown
  # Manual Test Procedures for Gaze Detection Application
  
  ## 1. Application Startup Tests
  
  ### 1.1 Basic Startup Test
  
  **Objective:** Verify application launches correctly and initializes all components
  
  **Procedure:**
  1. Launch the application
  2. Observe startup sequence
  3. Wait for initialization to complete
  
  **Expected Results:**
  - Application window appears without errors
  - Model loading progress is displayed
  - Camera permission is requested
  - Application reaches ready state
  
  **Pass Criteria:**
  - No error messages or crashes
  - All initialization steps complete successfully
  - UI shows ready state within 10 seconds
  
  ### 1.2 Camera Permission Test
  
  **Objective:** Verify application handles camera permissions correctly
  
  **Procedure:**
  1. Launch the application
  2. When prompted, deny camera permission
  3. Observe application response
  4. Close and relaunch application
  5. Grant camera permission
  
  **Expected Results:**
  - Application shows meaningful error when permission denied
  - Instructions for enabling camera are displayed
  - After relaunch and permission grant, camera initializes correctly
  
  **Pass Criteria:**
  - Clear error messaging for denied permission
  - No crashes on permission denial
  - Camera works after permission grant
  ```

- Develop test cases for core functions:
  - Face detection testing
  - Eye contact detection testing
  - Configuration testing
  - Error handling testing
  - Performance testing

- Create test case template:
  - Objective: Clear statement of what's being tested
  - Prerequisites: Required setup or conditions
  - Procedure: Step-by-step instructions
  - Expected Results: What should happen
  - Pass Criteria: How to determine success
  - Notes: Important observations or variations

- Include visual aids:
  - Screenshots of correct application states
  - Diagrams of expected behaviors
  - Visual indicators of success/failure
  - Example output for comparison

- Document test environment requirements:
  - Minimum hardware specifications
  - Camera requirements
  - Lighting conditions
  - Operating system requirements
  - Screen resolution

- Common pitfalls to avoid:
  - Vague test steps open to interpretation
  - Missing expected results
  - Inadequate coverage of edge cases
  - Overly complex procedures
  - Unstated prerequisites

### Dependencies
- Requires implementation of all core features
- Maximum time box: 5 hours
