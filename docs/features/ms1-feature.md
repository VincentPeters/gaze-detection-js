## 1. Purpose & Value
- **Goal:** Set up the minimal development environment required to start building the eye contact detection application
- **Value:** Provides the foundation for all subsequent development with minimal configuration overhead
- **Success Criteria:** Developers can run a basic Electron application with React integration and have access to webcam

## 2. Functional Requirements
- **Must Have:**
  - Basic Electron project structure with main and renderer processes
  - React integration for UI development
  - Node.js dependencies management
  - Development build process
  - Webcam access capabilities

- **Won't Have:**
  - Production build optimizations
  - Multiple window management
  - Complex state management
  - Cross-platform configuration

## 3. Implementation Tasks

### Task MS1-1: Create Basic Electron Project Structure
**Objective:** Set up the minimal Electron application structure with main and renderer processes
**Status:** âœ… Completed

**Starting Point:**
- Empty project directory

**Done When:**
- Basic Electron main.js file created
- Main process creates and manages a single window
- Application launches with "Hello World" content
- Developer can run the application with a single command

**Simplest Approach:**
- Use electron-forge to bootstrap the project
- Remove any unnecessary boilerplate
- Focus on single window creation only

### Task MS1-2: Integrate React for UI Development
**Objective:** Add React to the Electron renderer process for UI development

**Starting Point:**
- Basic Electron application from Task MS1-1

**Done When:**
- React renders in the Electron window
- Hot reloading works for UI development
- Basic component structure is established

**Simplest Approach:**
- Use Create React App for the renderer or simple webpack configuration
- Minimal CSS setup (just enough to display content)
- Focus on functional components only

### Task MS1-3: Add Webcam Access Capabilities
**Objective:** Enable access to the webcam for video capture

**Starting Point:**
- Electron application with React from Task MS1-2

**Done When:**
- Application can request and receive webcam permissions
- Video feed can be displayed in a basic component
- Feed can be started and stopped

**Simplest Approach:**
- Use browser's MediaDevices API
- Create a simple React component for video display
- Implement basic error handling for permission issues

### Task MS1-4: Configure Basic Development Workflow
**Objective:** Establish a streamlined development workflow

**Starting Point:**
- Electron React application with webcam access

**Done When:**
- Developer can make changes and see results quickly
- Basic scripts for starting and building the application
- Simple project structure documentation

**Simplest Approach:**
- Configure scripts in package.json
- Create minimal README with setup instructions
- Focus on developer experience for rapid iteration

## 4. Basic Testing Approach
- **Manual Test:** Developer launches application, confirms window appears with React content, and webcam permission is requested
- **Edge Cases:** Application handles webcam permission denial gracefully

## 5. Dependencies
- **Required Before:** None (this is the starting point)
- **Enables:** All subsequent features that require the application environment
