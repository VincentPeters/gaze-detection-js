# Feature MS3: Basic Window Management

## 1. Objective and Scope
- **Primary Goal:** Implement the fundamental multi-window management system using Electron, allowing for the main application window and additional windows for configuration, face panels, and logging.
- **User/System Value:** Provides the core user interface framework that enables the application's multi-window interaction model, essential for showing multiple faces and configuration options simultaneously.
- **Feature Boundaries:** 
  - In scope: Main application window, window creation/management, window state persistence, inter-window communication.
  - Out of scope: Specific UI components within windows, business logic implementation, actual face detection functionality.
- **Relationship to Project Goals:** The multi-window management system is a critical component of the eye contact detection application, allowing it to display multiple face streams and configuration options simultaneously, mirroring the functionality of the original Python application.

## 2. Functional Requirements
- **Key Capabilities:**
  - Create and manage multiple application windows
  - Establish a main window that controls the application lifecycle
  - Support for secondary windows (face panels, configuration, logs)
  - Persist window positions, sizes, and states between sessions
  - Coordinate communication between different windows
  - Handle window events (close, minimize, maximize, focus, blur)

- **User Interactions:**
  - Users should be able to open, close, resize, and reposition windows
  - Windows should maintain their positions and sizes between application sessions
  - Windows should respond appropriately to system events (display changes, etc.)
  - Users should be able to focus on specific windows for interaction

- **System Interactions:**
  - Windows should communicate with each other through a defined channel
  - Main window should control the application lifecycle
  - Windows should be able to access shared application state
  - Windows should respond to system-level events appropriately

- **Expected Outcomes:**
  - A functioning multi-window system that allows for simultaneous display of multiple application components
  - Consistent and reliable window behavior across different operating systems
  - Persistence of window configurations between application sessions
  - Effective communication between different application windows

## 3. Technical Approach
- **Architectural Considerations:**
  - Relationship between main window and secondary windows
  - Management of window lifecycle events
  - Performance implications of multiple renderer processes
  - Cross-platform compatibility considerations
  - Security boundaries between windows

- **Technology Options:**
  - Electron's BrowserWindow API
  - IPC for inter-window communication
  - Electron Store or similar for persistence
  - React for window content rendering

- **Integration Points:**
  - With the main process for window creation and management
  - With state management system for shared application state
  - With persistence layer for saving window configurations
  - With system APIs for display and window management

- **Scalability Considerations:**
  - Support for potentially many face panel windows
  - Memory and performance impact of multiple renderer processes
  - Graceful handling of resource constraints
  - Adaptability to different screen sizes and configurations

## 4. Implementation Tasks
Break down into outcome-oriented tasks that describe WHAT to accomplish, not HOW:

### Task MS3-1: Main Application Window Implementation
**Objective:** Create and configure the main application window that will serve as the primary interface and control the application lifecycle.

**Full details in task file:** `/docs/features/MS3/feature_task_1.md`

### Task MS3-2: Window Management System
**Objective:** Develop a system for creating, tracking, and managing multiple application windows.

**Full details in task file:** `/docs/features/MS3/feature_task_2.md`

### Task MS3-3: Window State Persistence
**Objective:** Implement functionality to save and restore window positions, sizes, and states between application sessions.

**Full details in task file:** `/docs/features/MS3/feature_task_3.md`

### Task MS3-4: Inter-Window Communication
**Objective:** Establish reliable communication channels between different application windows.

**Full details in task file:** `/docs/features/MS3/feature_task_4.md`

### Task MS3-5: Window Event Handling
**Objective:** Implement handlers for various window events to ensure appropriate application behavior.

**Full details in task file:** `/docs/features/MS3/feature_task_5.md`

## 5. Interaction & Behavior Specifications
- **User Flow Diagrams:**
  ```
  Application Launch -> Main Window Created -> User Opens Config Window -> Config Window Appears -> User Makes Changes -> Changes Reflected in Main Window
  
  Application Launch -> Main Window Created -> Face Detected -> Face Panel Window Created -> User Interacts with Face Panel -> Actions Reflected in System
  ```

- **System Behavior Descriptions:**
  - When the application launches, the main window should be created and positioned according to saved preferences or defaults
  - When a new face is detected, a face panel window should be created to display it
  - When the user changes configuration settings, these changes should be reflected across all relevant windows
  - When a window is closed, resources associated with it should be properly released

- **State Transitions:**
  - From application launch to initialized window system
  - From single window to multiple windows
  - From window creation to window destruction
  - From foreground focus to background operation

- **Error Scenarios:**
  - Handle failure to create a window
  - Manage situations where saved window positions are no longer valid (e.g., display configuration changed)
  - Recover from renderer process crashes
  - Handle resource constraints when creating multiple windows

## 6. Testing Verification
- **Verification Approach:**
  - Manual testing of window creation and management
  - Automated tests for window state persistence
  - Cross-platform testing of window behavior
  - Stress testing with multiple windows

- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Creating and manipulating multiple windows
  - Saving and restoring window states between sessions
  - Communication between different windows
  - Handling of window events (close, resize, etc.)
  - Recovery from window creation failures

- **Success Indicators:**
  - Windows are created and displayed correctly across platforms
  - Window states persist correctly between application sessions
  - Communication between windows functions reliably
  - Application handles window events appropriately
  - System recovers gracefully from window-related errors

- **Edge Cases:**
  - Multiple monitor setups with different resolutions and DPI settings
  - Systems with limited resources (memory, GPU)
  - Changing display configurations while the application is running
  - High DPI displays and scaling settings
  - Unusual window sizes and positions
