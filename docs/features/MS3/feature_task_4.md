# Task MS3-4: Inter-Window Communication

## Objective
Establish reliable communication channels between different application windows, enabling coordinated functionality and synchronized state across the main window, face panels, configuration windows, and logging windows.

## Starting Context
- **System State:** 
  - Development environment has been set up (MS1)
  - Project structure and architecture have been defined (MS2)
  - Inter-process communication framework exists (MS2-3)
  - Main application window implementation exists (MS3-1)
  - Window management system exists (MS3-2)
  - Window state persistence exists (MS3-3)
  - No specific inter-window communication exists yet
- **Available Resources:** 
  - Electron IPC documentation
  - Defined project structure and architecture
  - Window management system
  - Inter-process communication framework
- **Constraints:** 
  - Must work within Electron's security model
  - Must support communication across multiple windows
  - Must be performant for frequent updates
  - Must be reliable with dynamically created/destroyed windows
  - Must integrate with existing IPC framework

## Expected Outcome
- **Functional Result:** A reliable and efficient system for communication between different application windows, enabling synchronized functionality across the application.
- **System Changes:** 
  - Inter-window communication channels established
  - Message routing between windows implemented
  - Window-specific addressing mechanism created
  - Communication patterns for common scenarios defined
  - Integration with window lifecycle management
- **Observable Indicators:** 
  - Windows can exchange messages reliably
  - State changes in one window are reflected in others
  - Windows can coordinate actions
  - Communication works with dynamically created windows
  - Performance remains good with frequent communication

## Interaction Specification
- **Input Handling:** 
  - Messages from various windows
  - Window creation and destruction events
  - Communication channel establishment requests
  - Window identification and addressing
- **Output Generation:** 
  - Message delivery to target windows
  - Confirmation of message receipt when required
  - Error reporting for communication failures
  - Communication event logging
- **Error Handling:** 
  - Messages to non-existent windows should be handled gracefully
  - Communication errors should be detected and reported
  - Recovery strategies for communication failures
  - Resource constraints in high-traffic scenarios
- **State Changes:** 
  - During communication channel establishment
  - When windows are created or destroyed
  - During message transmission and reception
  - When communication patterns change

## Verification Approach
- **Manual Verification Steps:** 
  - Test communication between main window and secondary windows
  - Verify state synchronization across windows
  - Check communication with dynamically created windows
  - Test communication during window creation/destruction
  - Verify communication performance with frequent updates
- **Automated Test Approach:** 
  - Create tests for inter-window message passing
  - Implement tests for window addressing
  - Test communication with window lifecycle events
  - Verify correct error handling
  - Test performance under load
- **Integration Check Points:** 
  - Ensure compatibility with window management system
  - Verify integration with existing IPC framework
  - Check proper event handling for window lifecycle
  - Confirm security considerations are addressed
  - Test with different window types and purposes
