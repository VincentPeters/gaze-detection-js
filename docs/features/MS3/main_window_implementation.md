# Main Window Implementation

## Overview

The main window implementation provides a robust solution for creating and managing the primary application window for the Gaze Detection application. It follows a class-based approach with clear separation of concerns, handling window creation, state persistence, event management, and integration with other system components.

## Implementation Details

### MainWindow Class

The `MainWindow` class encapsulates all functionality related to the main application window:

- **Window Creation and Configuration**: Creates a properly configured Electron BrowserWindow with secure settings.
- **State Persistence**: Saves and restores window position, size, and maximized state between sessions.
- **Event Handling**: Manages window events like resize, move, close, and content navigation.
- **Security Measures**: Implements proper security settings including context isolation and controlled navigation.
- **Menu Integration**: Creates and manages application menus with platform-specific behaviors.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Integrates with the KeyboardShortcutManager for global keyboard shortcuts.

### Key Features

1. **Window State Persistence**
   - Saves window size, position, and state (maximized/normal) between sessions
   - Restores window to the previous state when application launches
   - Handles edge cases like minimized state and screen boundary changes

2. **Secure Configuration**
   - Uses contextIsolation, sandbox mode, and disables remote module
   - Controls external link handling and prevents navigation to unknown URLs
   - Proper preload script integration for IPC communication

3. **Platform Awareness**
   - Adapts menu structure for different platforms (macOS, Windows, Linux)
   - Sets appropriate window icons for different platforms
   - Handles platform-specific window behaviors

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Defers window display until content is ready to prevent white flashing
   - Sets appropriate background color during loading
   - Efficient event handling to prevent memory leaks

5. **Developer Experience**
   - Development tools integration in development mode
   - Helpful logging throughout the window lifecycle
   - Clean error handling and reporting

## Architecture Integration

The MainWindow class is integrated with other system components:

- **WindowManager**: The WindowManager uses the MainWindow class to create and manage the main window
- **State Store**: Window state is persisted using the application's state store
- **Keyboard Shortcut Manager**: Global shortcuts are registered through the window instance
- **IPC System**: The window serves as a communication channel for IPC messages

## Usage Example

The MainWindow class is used by creating an instance and calling the create method:

```javascript
// Create an instance
const mainWindow = new MainWindow();

// Create the window
const window = mainWindow.create();

// Access the window
const browserWindow = mainWindow.getWindow();

// Close the window
mainWindow.close();
```

## Security Considerations

The implementation includes several security features:

- Context isolation to separate the renderer process from Node.js
- Sandbox mode to restrict renderer process capabilities
- Controlled navigation to prevent unexpected redirects
- Secure external link handling to prevent command injection
- Disabled remote module to prevent privilege escalation

## Testing

The MainWindow implementation includes comprehensive tests that verify:

- Window creation and configuration
- State loading and saving
- Window lifecycle events
- Platform-specific behaviors
- Error handling scenarios

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements could include:

- Support for multiple display configurations
- Enhanced crash recovery
- Improved startup performance
- Additional window customization options
- Accessibility improvements
