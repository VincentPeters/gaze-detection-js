# Task MS3-2: Window Management System

## Objective
Develop a system for creating, tracking, and managing multiple application windows, enabling coordinated operation of the main window, face panels, configuration windows, and logging windows.

## Starting Context
- **System State:** 
  - Development environment has been set up (MS1)
  - Project structure and architecture have been defined (MS2)
  - Main application window implementation exists (MS3-1)
  - No window management system exists yet
- **Available Resources:** 
  - Electron BrowserWindow API documentation
  - Defined project structure and architecture
  - Inter-process communication framework
  - Main window implementation
- **Constraints:** 
  - Must support different window types and purposes
  - Must handle dynamic creation and destruction of windows
  - Must manage window relationships and dependencies
  - Must be scalable to potentially many windows
  - Must maintain consistent application state across windows

## Expected Outcome
- **Functional Result:** A comprehensive window management system that controls the creation, tracking, relationship, and lifecycle of multiple application windows.
- **System Changes:** 
  - Window manager implementation in the main process
  - Window type definitions and configurations
  - Window tracking and reference management
  - Window coordination mechanisms
  - Window lifecycle management
- **Observable Indicators:** 
  - Multiple window types can be created and managed
  - Windows maintain appropriate relationships (parent-child, etc.)
  - Window references are properly tracked and managed
  - Window lifecycles are handled correctly (creation to destruction)
  - Application can scale to handle multiple windows efficiently

## Interaction Specification
- **Input Handling:** 
  - Window creation requests from various sources
  - Window management commands (bring to front, minimize all, etc.)
  - Window relationship management (parent-child, dependencies)
  - Window position and layout requests
- **Output Generation:** 
  - Creation of appropriately configured windows
  - Maintenance of window state information
  - Window reference tracking for access by other components
  - Window layout coordination
- **Error Handling:** 
  - Failed window creation should be handled gracefully
  - Orphaned window references should be detected and cleaned up
  - Resource constraints should be detected and managed
  - Window manager failures should not crash the application
- **State Changes:** 
  - From window creation request to window existence
  - During window lifecycle management
  - When window relationships change
  - During application shutdown and window cleanup

## Verification Approach
- **Manual Verification Steps:** 
  - Create different types of windows through application actions
  - Verify proper window relationships and behaviors
  - Test window lifecycle from creation to destruction
  - Check resource management with many windows
  - Test window management functions (minimize all, etc.)
- **Automated Test Approach:** 
  - Create tests for window creation and configuration
  - Implement tests for window manager functions
  - Test window lifecycle management
  - Verify proper cleanup on application exit
  - Test performance with multiple windows
- **Integration Check Points:** 
  - Ensure compatibility with main window implementation
  - Verify integration with IPC framework
  - Check compatibility with state management approach
  - Confirm proper use of Electron APIs for window management

## Decision Guidance
- **Key Decisions:** 
  - Window manager architecture and design
  - Window tracking and reference management approach
  - Window type definitions and configuration
  - Window coordination and positioning strategy
  - Window lifecycle management approach
- **Consideration Factors:** 
  - Performance with multiple windows
  - Memory and resource management
  - Code maintainability and flexibility
  - Integration with existing architecture
  - User experience across different platforms
- **Tradeoff Analysis:** 
  - Centralized vs. distributed window management
  - Eager vs. lazy window creation
  - Static vs. dynamic window configurations
  - Strict vs. flexible window relationships
  - Complete vs. minimal window tracking

## Dependencies
- **Preceding Tasks:** 
  - MS1: Environment Setup (all subtasks)
  - MS2-2: Main and Renderer Process Architecture
  - MS2-3: Inter-Process Communication Framework
  - MS3-1: Main Application Window Implementation
- **Following Tasks:** 
  - MS3-3: Window State Persistence
  - MS3-4: Inter-Window Communication
  - MS3-5: Window Event Handling
  - EN2-2: Face Panel Components
- **External Dependencies:** 
  - Electron BrowserWindow API
  - Node.js event system
  - Operating system window management
  - Available system resources (memory, etc.)

## Effort Estimation
- **Complexity Assessment:** High
