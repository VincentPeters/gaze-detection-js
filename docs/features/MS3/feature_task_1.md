# Task MS3-1: Main Application Window Implementation

## Objective
Create and configure the main application window that will serve as the primary interface and control the application lifecycle, establishing the central point of interaction for the eye contact detection application.

## Starting Context
- **System State:** 
  - Development environment has been set up (MS1)
  - Project structure and architecture have been defined (MS2)
  - No application windows exist yet
- **Available Resources:** 
  - Electron BrowserWindow API documentation
  - Defined project structure
  - Inter-process communication framework
  - React integration for UI components
- **Constraints:** 
  - Must be compatible with multiple operating systems
  - Must support responsive layout for different screen sizes
  - Must integrate with application lifecycle management
  - Must provide proper security context isolation

## Expected Outcome
- **Functional Result:** A fully configured main application window that displays correctly, manages application lifecycle, and serves as the primary interface for the eye contact detection application.
- **System Changes:** 
  - Main window creation and configuration code implemented
  - Window content loading mechanism established
  - Basic application menu integrated with the window
  - Window event handling for application lifecycle events
  - Development tools access configured
- **Observable Indicators:** 
  - Application launches with a properly sized and positioned main window
  - Window displays the initial application interface
  - Window responds to standard window operations (resize, maximize, minimize, close)
  - Application lifecycle events (quit, focus, blur) are properly handled
  - Developer tools can be accessed in development mode

## Interaction Specification
- **Input Handling:** 
  - Window should respond to standard window management commands
  - Window should process startup parameters and arguments
  - Window should handle system events (power events, display changes)
  - Window should accept keyboard shortcuts for standard operations
- **Output Generation:** 
  - Window should render the application interface
  - Window should display appropriate title and icon
  - Window should provide visual feedback for state changes
  - Window should reflect system theme if appropriate
- **Error Handling:** 
  - Failed window creation should be reported clearly
  - Renderer process crashes should be handled gracefully
  - Resource access errors should be reported
  - Recovery procedures should be defined for common failure scenarios
- **State Changes:** 
  - From application launch to window display
  - Between window focus states (focused, blurred)
  - Between window size states (normal, maximized, minimized)
  - During application shutdown sequence

## Verification Approach
- **Manual Verification Steps:** 
  - Launch application and verify window appearance
  - Test window resizing, maximizing, minimizing
  - Verify correct handling of close operation
  - Check developer tools accessibility
  - Test window behavior on different displays and resolutions
- **Automated Test Approach:** 
  - Create tests for window creation and configuration
  - Implement tests for window event handling
  - Test application lifecycle management
  - Verify window properties and behavior programmatically
- **Integration Check Points:** 
  - Ensure compatibility with the project's architectural patterns
  - Verify integration with IPC framework
  - Check compatibility with state management approach
  - Confirm window content loading mechanism works with React

## Decision Guidance
- **Key Decisions:** 
  - Window creation timing and approach
  - Default window properties (size, position, appearance)
  - Content loading strategy
  - Developer tools availability and access
  - Application lifecycle handling approach
- **Consideration Factors:** 
  - User experience across different platforms
  - Performance implications of window configuration
  - Security considerations for main window
  - Development and debugging experience
  - Platform-specific behavior differences
- **Tradeoff Analysis:** 
  - Single window vs. multi-window architecture
  - Default window settings vs. user preferences
  - Native window appearance vs. custom styling
  - Strict security settings vs. development convenience
  - Eager vs. lazy resource loading

## Dependencies
- **Preceding Tasks:** 
  - MS1: Environment Setup (all subtasks)
  - MS2-2: Main and Renderer Process Architecture
  - MS2-3: Inter-Process Communication Framework
- **Following Tasks:** 
  - MS3-2: Window Management System
  - MS3-3: Window State Persistence
  - MS3-4: Inter-Window Communication
  - MS3-5: Window Event Handling
- **External Dependencies:** 
  - Electron BrowserWindow API
  - Node.js environment for main process
  - Operating system window management
  - React for window content (if using React)

## Effort Estimation
- **Complexity Assessment:** Medium
- **Skill Areas:** 
  - Electron application development
  - Window management in desktop applications
  - Application lifecycle management
  - Cross-platform desktop development
  - Security considerations in Electron
- **Risk Factors:** 
  - Cross-platform consistency challenges
  - Window management edge cases
  - Electron security configuration complexity
  - Performance considerations for window rendering
  - Integration with application state management
