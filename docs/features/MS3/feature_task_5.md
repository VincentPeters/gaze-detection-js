# Task MS3-5: Window Event Handling

## Objective
Implement handlers for various window events to ensure appropriate application behavior, creating a responsive and reliable user experience across different operating systems and usage scenarios.

## Starting Context
- **System State:** 
  - Development environment has been set up (MS1)
  - Project structure and architecture have been defined (MS2)
  - Main application window implementation exists (MS3-1)
  - Window management system exists (MS3-2)
  - Window state persistence exists (MS3-3)
  - Inter-window communication exists (MS3-4)
  - No comprehensive window event handling exists yet
- **Available Resources:** 
  - Electron window event documentation
  - Defined project structure and architecture
  - Window management system
  - Inter-window communication framework
- **Constraints:** 
  - Must handle all relevant window events across platforms
  - Must integrate with window management system
  - Must coordinate with application lifecycle management
  - Must support custom event handling for different window types
  - Must be reliable across operating systems

## Expected Outcome
- **Functional Result:** A comprehensive window event handling system that responds appropriately to all window events, providing a smooth and reliable user experience.
- **System Changes:** 
  - Window event handler implementation
  - Event routing and delegation system
  - Custom event handling for different window types
  - Coordination with application lifecycle events
  - Integration with window state management
- **Observable Indicators:** 
  - Application responds properly to window close, minimize, maximize events
  - Focus and blur events are handled appropriately
  - Window position and size change events trigger appropriate actions
  - System events (like display changes) are handled correctly
  - Custom window behaviors work reliably

## Interaction Specification
- **Input Handling:** 
  - Window lifecycle events (create, show, close, etc.)
  - Window state events (maximize, minimize, restore, etc.)
  - Window focus events (focus, blur)
  - Window position and size events (move, resize)
  - System events affecting windows (display changes, etc.)
- **Output Generation:** 
  - Appropriate responses to window events
  - State updates based on window events
  - Notifications to other application components
  - User feedback when relevant
  - Logging of significant window events
- **Error Handling:** 
  - Event handler errors should be contained
  - Missing handlers should be gracefully handled
  - Event sequence issues should be managed
  - Platform-specific event differences should be normalized
  - Resource constraints during event handling should be considered
- **State Changes:** 
  - During window lifecycle events
  - When window state changes
  - When focus changes between windows
  - When window position or size changes
  - When system events affect windows

## Verification Approach
- **Manual Verification Steps:** 
  - Test all standard window operations (close, minimize, maximize)
  - Verify focus behavior with multiple windows
  - Check response to window movement and resizing
  - Test behavior with system events (display changes, etc.)
  - Verify custom behaviors for different window types
- **Automated Test Approach:** 
  - Create tests for standard window event handling
  - Implement tests for event routing and delegation
  - Test integration with window management system
  - Verify coordination with application lifecycle
  - Test cross-platform consistency where possible
- **Integration Check Points:** 
  - Ensure compatibility with window management system
  - Verify integration with window state persistence
  - Check proper coordination with inter-window communication
  - Confirm alignment with application lifecycle management
  - Test with different window types and purposes

## Decision Guidance
- **Key Decisions:** 
  - Event handling architecture
  - Event delegation and routing approach
  - Custom event handling for different window types
  - Platform-specific event normalization
  - Integration with application state management
- **Consideration Factors:** 
  - Cross-platform consistency
  - Performance implications of event handling
  - Developer experience and maintainability
  - User experience and responsiveness
  - Integration with existing architecture
- **Tradeoff Analysis:** 
  - Centralized vs. distributed event handling
  - Declarative vs. imperative event handling
  - Synchronous vs. asynchronous event processing
  - Fine-grained vs. coarse-grained event types
  - Platform-specific vs. platform-agnostic approach
