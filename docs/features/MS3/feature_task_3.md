# Task MS3-3: Window State Persistence

## Objective
Implement functionality to save and restore window positions, sizes, and states between application sessions, providing a consistent user experience across application restarts.

## Starting Context
- **System State:** 
  - Development environment has been set up (MS1)
  - Project structure and architecture have been defined (MS2)
  - Main application window implementation exists (MS3-1)
  - Window management system exists (MS3-2)
  - No window state persistence exists yet
- **Available Resources:** 
  - Electron state persistence documentation
  - Defined project structure and architecture
  - Window management system
  - Configuration system (if available)
- **Constraints:** 
  - Must work across multiple operating systems
  - Must handle various window properties (position, size, state, display)
  - Must handle invalid or outdated persisted state
  - Must integrate with window management system
  - Should support user preferences for default states

## Expected Outcome
- **Functional Result:** A reliable system for persisting and restoring window states across application sessions, maintaining a consistent user experience.
- **System Changes:** 
  - Window state persistence mechanism implementation
  - State saving triggers on relevant window events
  - State restoration during window creation
  - Validation logic for persisted state
  - Default state handling for new installations
- **Observable Indicators:** 
  - Windows reopen in their previous positions and sizes
  - Window states (maximized, etc.) are preserved
  - Invalid states are handled gracefully with reasonable defaults
  - Window state changes are saved promptly
  - Multiple window states are managed correctly

## Interaction Specification
- **Input Handling:** 
  - Window state change events (move, resize, maximize, etc.)
  - Application shutdown events for final state saving
  - Persisted state during application startup
  - User preferences for default states
- **Output Generation:** 
  - Persistent storage of window state information
  - Window configuration based on persisted state
  - Logging of state persistence operations
  - Error handling for invalid states
- **Error Handling:** 
  - Invalid persisted states should be detected and ignored
  - Missing state information should fall back to defaults
  - Storage failures should be caught and reported
  - Multi-monitor configuration changes should be handled
- **State Changes:** 
  - During window creation using persisted state
  - When window properties change (size, position, state)
  - During application shutdown
  - When display configuration changes

## Verification Approach
- **Manual Verification Steps:** 
  - Modify window positions and sizes, then restart application
  - Test maximized, minimized, and normal window states
  - Verify behavior with multiple windows
  - Test with changed display configurations
  - Check behavior on first run with no persisted state
- **Automated Test Approach:** 
  - Create tests for state saving and loading
  - Implement tests for state validation
  - Test with simulated display configuration changes
  - Verify correct behavior with corrupt state data
  - Test performance with many windows
- **Integration Check Points:** 
  - Ensure compatibility with window management system
  - Verify integration with application configuration system
  - Check proper event handling for state changes
  - Confirm cross-platform consistency
  - Test with multiple window types

## Decision Guidance
- **Key Decisions:** 
  - Storage mechanism for window states
  - State persistence frequency and triggers
  - State validation and sanitization approach
  - Default state strategy
  - Multi-monitor handling approach
- **Consideration Factors:** 
  - Performance impact of frequent state saving
  - Storage size and format efficiency
  - Reliability across application restarts
  - User experience with changed display setups
  - Handling of window state conflicts
- **Tradeoff Analysis:** 
  - Frequent vs. infrequent state saving
  - Detailed vs. minimal state persistence
  - Strict vs. flexible state validation
  - Complex vs. simple multi-monitor handling
  - Centralized vs. per-window state storage
