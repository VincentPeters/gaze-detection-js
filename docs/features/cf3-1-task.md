## Task CF3-1: Convert Eye Contact Model to TensorFlow.js [ ]

### Status
- [x] Not Started
- [ ] In Progress
- [ ] Complete
- [ ] Verified

### Objective
Transform the existing PyTorch eye contact detection model to TensorFlow.js format that can be used within a browser environment while maintaining comparable accuracy and performance.

### Starting Point
- Original PyTorch model from Python application
- Model architecture documentation (if available)
- Sample input/output data for validation

### Done When
- Model is successfully converted to TensorFlow.js format
- Converted model loads in the JavaScript application without errors
- Input/output tensor shapes match the original model
- Model size is appropriate for web delivery (under 10MB if possible)
- Model produces predictions with accuracy comparable to original
- Sample test cases pass with expected results
- Loading and inference times are acceptable for real-time use

### Implementation Guidelines
- Use ONNX as an intermediate conversion format:
  1. Convert PyTorch model to ONNX format using torch.onnx.export
  2. Convert ONNX model to TensorFlow.js using tfjs-converter
  
- If direct conversion presents issues:
  1. Consider simplifying model architecture
  2. Evaluate smaller model variants if available
  3. Last resort: implement simplified model directly in TensorFlow.js
  
- For model loading:
  - Store model files in the application's assets directory
  - Implement progressive loading with status indicators
  - Cache model after initial load to improve startup time
  
- Common pitfalls to avoid:
  - Input normalization differences between PyTorch and TensorFlow
  - Tensor dimension ordering (NCHW vs NHWC)
  - Precision differences between Python and JavaScript
  - Browser memory constraints with large models

### Dependencies
- Requires original PyTorch model files
- Need sample test images from original application for validation
- Maximum time box: 8 hours (if taking longer, consider fallback approaches)
- If conversion proves overly complex, create a simplified model focused only on core functionality
