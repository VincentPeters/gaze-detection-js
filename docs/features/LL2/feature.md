# Feature LL2: Deployment Configuration

## 1. Objective and Scope
- **Primary Goal:** Configure deployment settings for the application, including installation processes, updates, and distribution mechanisms.
- **User/System Value:** Enables smooth distribution and updates of the application to end users, ensuring they can easily install, update, and use the software.
- **Feature Boundaries:** 
  - In scope: Installation package configuration, update mechanism, distribution channel setup, environment-specific settings, release management system.
  - Out of scope: App store submissions, automated deployment pipelines, marketing materials, detailed analytics.
- **Relationship to Project Goals:** Effective deployment configuration ensures that the eye contact detection application reaches its intended users with minimal friction, supporting the overall goal of creating an accessible and usable application.

## 2. Functional Requirements
- **Key Capabilities:**
  - Configure installation packages for different platforms
  - Implement an update mechanism for delivering new versions
  - Set up distribution channels for the application
  - Define environment-specific settings for different deployment scenarios
  - Create a release management process for versioning and distribution

- **User Interactions:**
  - End users should be able to install the application easily
  - End users should receive notifications about available updates
  - End users should be able to update the application with minimal friction
  - End users should have appropriate permissions set automatically during installation

- **System Interactions:**
  - The system should package installation files appropriately
  - The system should check for updates from distribution channels
  - The system should apply updates when available
  - The system should adapt to different deployment environments

- **Expected Outcomes:**
  - Smooth installation experience across platforms
  - Reliable update mechanism for delivering new versions
  - Effective distribution channel for the application
  - Clear versioning and release management process
  - Appropriate configuration for different deployment environments

## 3. Technical Approach
- **Architectural Considerations:**
  - Installation package formats and requirements
  - Update mechanism design and security
  - Distribution channel infrastructure
  - Environment configuration management
  - Version control and release processes

- **Technology Options:**
  - Installation: Platform-native installers, Electron packagers
  - Updates: Electron autoUpdater, custom update mechanisms
  - Distribution: Direct download, private repositories, file sharing
  - Environment Configuration: Configuration files, environment variables

- **Integration Points:**
  - With build system for package generation
  - With application code for update mechanisms
  - With configuration system for environment settings
  - With version control for release management

- **Scalability Considerations:**
  - Handling increasing number of installations
  - Managing updates for multiple versions
  - Supporting multiple distribution channels
  - Scaling across different deployment environments

## 4. Implementation Tasks
Break down into outcome-oriented tasks that describe WHAT to accomplish, not HOW:

### Task LL2-1: Installation Package Configuration
**Objective:** Configure installation packages for smooth installation across platforms.

**Full details in task file:** `/docs/features/LL2/feature_task_1.md`

### Task LL2-2: Update Mechanism Implementation
**Objective:** Implement a system for checking, downloading, and applying application updates.

**Full details in task file:** `/docs/features/LL2/feature_task_2.md`

### Task LL2-3: Distribution Channel Setup
**Objective:** Establish channels for distributing the application to end users.

**Full details in task file:** `/docs/features/LL2/feature_task_3.md`

### Task LL2-4: Environment-specific Configuration
**Objective:** Define and implement configuration settings specific to different deployment environments.

**Full details in task file:** `/docs/features/LL2/feature_task_4.md`

### Task LL2-5: Release Management System
**Objective:** Create a system for managing versions, releases, and distribution of the application.

**Full details in task file:** `/docs/features/LL2/feature_task_5.md`

## 5. Interaction & Behavior Specifications
- **User Flow Diagrams:**
  ```
  User Downloads Installer -> Runs Installer -> Installation Process -> Application Ready to Use
  
  Application Running -> Update Check -> Update Available -> User Notified -> Update Downloaded -> Update Applied -> Application Restarted
  ```

- **System Behavior Descriptions:**
  - When the installer runs, it should set up the application with appropriate permissions
  - When the application starts, it should check for updates if configured to do so
  - When an update is available, the user should be notified appropriately
  - When an update is applied, the application should transition smoothly
  - When deployed in different environments, the application should adapt its configuration

- **State Transitions:**
  - From not installed to installed application
  - From current version to updated version
  - From development environment to production environment
  - From one distribution channel to another
  - From one release version to the next

- **Error Scenarios:**
  - Installation failures due to permissions or conflicts
  - Update failures due to network or validation issues
  - Distribution channel access problems
  - Environment configuration mismatches
  - Version conflicts during updates

## 6. Testing Verification
- **Verification Approach:**
  - Installation testing on different platforms
  - Update mechanism validation through simulated updates
  - Distribution channel testing with real and simulated channels
  - Environment configuration testing in different scenarios
  - Release process validation through trial releases

- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Fresh installation on different operating systems
  - Updates from various prior versions
  - Distribution through configured channels
  - Deployment in different target environments
  - Complete release cycle from build to distribution

- **Success Indicators:**
  - Successful installation across all platforms
  - Reliable update mechanism operation
  - Functional distribution through configured channels
  - Appropriate configuration across environments
  - Clear and effective release management

- **Edge Cases:**
  - Installation on systems with unusual configurations
  - Updates with large version gaps
  - Limited connectivity during update checks
  - Extreme environment differences
  - Concurrent updates and installations
