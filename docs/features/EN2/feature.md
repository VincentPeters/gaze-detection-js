# Feature EN2: User Interface Components

## 1. Objective and Scope
- **Primary Goal:** Develop a comprehensive set of user interface components for the application, including the main window, face panels, configuration interface, and visual feedback elements.
- **User/System Value:** Provides the visual interface through which users interact with the application, configure settings, and observe detection results, greatly enhancing usability and functionality.
- **Feature Boundaries:** 
  - In scope: Main application interface, face panel components, detection visualization overlays, configuration interface components, status indicators and feedback elements.
  - Out of scope: Business logic implementation, underlying detection algorithms, window management system.
- **Relationship to Project Goals:** The user interface is the primary means through which users interact with the eye contact detection functionality, making it essential for both usability and demonstration of the application's capabilities.

## 2. Functional Requirements
- **Key Capabilities:**
  - Display the video feed with detection overlays
  - Present individual face panels for detected faces
  - Provide configuration controls for adjusting application parameters
  - Display status information and system feedback
  - Visualize eye contact detection results
  - Enable user interaction with the application

- **User Interactions:**
  - Users should be able to view the camera feed with detection overlays
  - Users should be able to view and interact with individual face panels
  - Users should be able to adjust application settings through UI controls
  - Users should receive visual feedback about system status and detection results
  - Users should be able to navigate between different application views

- **System Interactions:**
  - The UI should display data from the detection systems
  - The UI should send configuration changes to the system
  - The UI should update in response to detection events
  - The UI should adapt to different window sizes and configurations

- **Expected Outcomes:**
  - A complete, intuitive user interface for all application functionality
  - Responsive visualization of detection results and system status
  - Accessible configuration controls for all adjustable parameters
  - Consistent design language across all UI components

## 3. Technical Approach
- **Architectural Considerations:**
  - Component-based UI architecture
  - State management for UI components
  - Performance optimization for real-time updates
  - Cross-platform UI consistency
  - Accessibility considerations

- **Technology Options:**
  - React for component-based UI development
  - CSS modules or styled-components for styling
  - Canvas or SVG for visualization overlays
  - React Context or Redux for UI state management

- **Integration Points:**
  - With window management system for rendering in appropriate windows
  - With detection systems for data visualization
  - With configuration system for settings controls
  - With media capture system for capture feedback

- **Scalability Considerations:**
  - Performance with multiple face panels
  - UI responsiveness during intensive processing
  - Adaptability to different screen sizes and resolutions
  - Maintainability as features are added or modified

## 4. Implementation Tasks
Break down into outcome-oriented tasks that describe WHAT to accomplish, not HOW:

### Task EN2-1: Main Application Interface
**Objective:** Create the primary application interface showing the video feed with detection overlays.

**Full details in task file:** `/docs/features/EN2/feature_task_1.md`

### Task EN2-2: Face Panel Components
**Objective:** Develop panel components for displaying individual detected faces and their status.

**Full details in task file:** `/docs/features/EN2/feature_task_2.md`

### Task EN2-3: Configuration Interface Components
**Objective:** Create UI components for adjusting and configuring application parameters.

**Full details in task file:** `/docs/features/EN2/feature_task_3.md`

### Task EN2-4: Detection Visualization Overlays
**Objective:** Implement visual overlays for displaying detection results on video feeds.

**Full details in task file:** `/docs/features/EN2/feature_task_4.md`

### Task EN2-5: Status Indicators and Feedback Elements
**Objective:** Develop UI components for providing system status and feedback to users.

**Full details in task file:** `/docs/features/EN2/feature_task_5.md`

## 5. Interaction & Behavior Specifications
- **User Flow Diagrams:**
  ```
  Launch Application -> View Main Window -> Observe Video Feed -> Face Detected -> Face Panel Opens -> Observe Eye Contact Status
  
  Access Configuration Panel -> Adjust Settings -> See Real-time Effects -> Close Configuration Panel
  ```

- **System Behavior Descriptions:**
  - When the application starts, the main interface should display the video feed
  - When a face is detected, a face panel should be created for that face
  - When eye contact is detected, appropriate visual indicators should display this state
  - When configuration controls are adjusted, the effects should be visible in real-time
  - When system events occur, status indicators should update accordingly

- **State Transitions:**
  - From empty video feed to face detection visualization
  - From no eye contact to eye contact state indicators
  - From default configuration to customized settings
  - From normal operation to error or warning states

- **Error Scenarios:**
  - Display appropriate visual feedback for detection failures
  - Show clear status information during resource constraints
  - Provide visual indicators for configuration conflicts
  - Gracefully handle UI rendering issues

## 6. Testing Verification
- **Verification Approach:**
  - Manual UI testing across platforms
  - Component unit testing
  - Usability testing with representative users
  - Performance testing under various conditions

- **Test Scenarios:**
  - UI responsiveness during normal operation
  - Display of detection overlays and indicators
  - Interaction with configuration controls
  - Adaptation to different window sizes and screen resolutions
  - Handling of multiple simultaneous face panels

- **Success Indicators:**
  - Intuitive and responsive user interface
  - Clear visualization of detection results
  - Accessible configuration controls
  - Consistent performance across platforms
  - Appropriate feedback for all system states

- **Edge Cases:**
  - Very high or low resolution displays
  - Touch screen vs. mouse interaction
  - High density of detection events
  - Extreme UI scaling requirements
  - Internationalization and localization considerations
