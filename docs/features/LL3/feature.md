- **Feature Boundaries:** 
  - In scope: User feedback collection mechanism, usage analytics, performance monitoring, error reporting, data analysis tools.
  - Out of scope: Advanced user behavior analysis, personalization features, automated system responses, invasive monitoring.
- **Relationship to Project Goals:** Feedback and monitoring support the ongoing improvement of the eye contact detection application, helping it evolve based on actual usage patterns and user needs.

## 2. Functional Requirements
- **Key Capabilities:**
  - Collect structured feedback from users about their experience
  - Gather anonymous usage statistics to understand application usage
  - Monitor application performance in deployed environments
  - Capture and report errors and issues for analysis
  - Provide tools for analyzing feedback and monitoring data
  - Ensure user privacy and data protection in all monitoring

- **User Interactions:**
  - Users should be able to provide feedback directly within the application
  - Users should be informed about and consent to any data collection
  - Users should be able to opt out of non-essential data collection
  - Users should benefit from improvements based on aggregated feedback

- **System Interactions:**
  - The system should collect feedback through integrated mechanisms
  - The system should gather performance metrics during operation
  - The system should report errors with appropriate context
  - The system should transmit collected data securely
  - The system should respect user privacy settings

- **Expected Outcomes:**
  - A comprehensive feedback and monitoring system
  - Valuable insights into application usage and performance
  - Timely identification of issues and opportunities for improvement
  - User-centered development guided by actual usage data
  - Improved application quality over time

## 3. Technical Approach
- **Architectural Considerations:**
  - Privacy by design principles
  - Data collection and transmission security
  - Performance impact of monitoring
  - Integration with application components
  - Data storage and analysis approaches

- **Technology Options:**
  - Feedback UI: Custom forms, integrated dialogs
  - Analytics: Custom solution, anonymized tracking
  - Performance Monitoring: Built-in metrics, custom profiling
  - Error Reporting: Structured logging, context capturing
  - Data Processing: Local analysis, simple aggregation

- **Integration Points:**
  - With UI components for feedback collection
  - With application code for performance monitoring
  - With error handling system for issue reporting
  - With logging system for event recording
  - With data storage for collected information

- **Scalability Considerations:**
  - Handling feedback from growing user base
  - Performance impact of monitoring at scale
  - Data storage and analysis requirements
  - Prioritization mechanisms for feedback processing

## 4. Implementation Tasks
Break down into outcome-oriented tasks that describe WHAT to accomplish, not HOW:

**Full details in task file:** `/docs/features/LL3/feature_task_3.md`

### Task LL3-4: Error Reporting System
**Objective:** Create a system for capturing and reporting errors with appropriate context.

**Full details in task file:** `/docs/features/LL3/feature_task_4.md`

### Task LL3-5: Data Analysis Tools
**Objective:** Provide tools and methods for analyzing collected feedback and monitoring data.

**Full details in task file:** `/docs/features/LL3/feature_task_5.md`

## 5. Interaction & Behavior Specifications
- **User Flow Diagrams:**
  ```
  User Experience Issue -> Open Feedback Form -> Provide Feedback -> Submit Feedback -> Confirmation Message
  
  Application Usage -> Anonymous Data Collection -> Performance Monitoring -> Error Detection -> Error Reporting -> Data Analysis
  ```

- **System Behavior Descriptions:**
  - When users encounter issues, they should have easy access to feedback mechanisms
  - When feedback is submitted, it should be stored with relevant context
  - When the application is used, anonymous usage statistics should be collected (with consent)
  - When performance metrics are gathered, they should have minimal impact on the application
  - When errors occur, they should be reported with sufficient context for analysis

- **State Transitions:**
  - From user experience to feedback collection
  - From application operation to data gathering
  - From error occurrence to detailed reporting
  - From data collection to analysis
  - From analysis to application improvement

- **Error Scenarios:**
  - Feedback submission failures
  - Data collection interruptions
  - Excessive performance impact from monitoring
  - Privacy setting violations
  - Data transmission or storage issues

## 6. Testing Verification
- **Verification Approach:**
  - Functional testing of feedback mechanisms
  - Performance impact assessment of monitoring
  - Privacy compliance verification
  - Data analysis tool validation
  - End-to-end testing of the feedback loop

- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Submitting various types of feedback
  - Monitoring application under different conditions
  - Error reporting in various scenarios
  - Data collection with different privacy settings
  - Analysis of collected data with provided tools

- **Success Indicators:**
  - Reliable feedback collection mechanisms
  - Minimal performance impact from monitoring
  - Comprehensive error reports with context
  - Useful insights from collected data
  - Improved application based on feedback

- **Edge Cases:**
  - Very large feedback submissions
  - Extremely frequent error conditions
  - Limited connectivity environments
  - Multiple simultaneous feedback submissions
  - Unexpected data patterns in monitoring
