## Task CF2-2: Implement Basic Face Detection [ ]

### Status
- [x] Not Started
- [ ] In Progress
- [ ] Complete
- [ ] Verified

### Objective
Detect faces in the webcam feed using face-api.js with appropriate performance and accuracy for the MVP requirements.

### Starting Point
- Application with face-api.js integrated from CF2-1
- Camera feed component from CF1-1

### Done When
- Application can detect faces in the webcam feed
- Detection results include bounding boxes
- Performance is at least 15fps on target hardware
- Detection confidence threshold is configurable
- Face detection visualization is implemented
- Detection works under various lighting conditions
- Basic detector performance metrics are available
- Detection process doesn't block the UI

### Implementation Guidelines
- Create face detection function:
  ```javascript
  async function detectFaces(videoElement, options = {}) {
    if (!videoElement || videoElement.paused || videoElement.ended) {
      return [];
    }
    
    const detectionOptions = new faceapi.SsdMobilenetv1Options({
      minConfidence: options.minConfidence || 0.5,
      maxResults: options.maxResults || 10
    });
    
    try {
      // Run detection
      const detections = await faceapi.detectAllFaces(
        videoElement, 
        detectionOptions
      ).withFaceLandmarks();
      
      return detections;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Face detection error:', error);
      return [];
    }
  }
  ```

- Implement detection loop:
  - Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth performance
  - Consider detecting on intervals for performance
  - Implement frame skipping if necessary
  - Add performance monitoring

- Create detection state management:
  - Store current detections in state
  - Track detection statistics (FPS, count)
  - Manage detection on/off state
  - Handle configuration changes

- Implement visualization component:
  - Draw bounding boxes around faces
  - Show confidence values (optional)
  - Use canvas overlay aligned with video
  - Create smooth transitions

- Add configuration options:
  - Detection confidence threshold
  - Detection frequency (performance vs. accuracy)
  - Maximum number of faces to detect
  - Visualization options

- Optimize for performance:
  - Use appropriate input sizes for detection
  - Consider resizing video frames before detection
  - Implement detection throttling if needed
  - Measure and log performance metrics

- Common pitfalls to avoid:
  - Running detection too frequently, causing lag
  - Not handling detection errors properly
  - Poor visualization alignment with video
  - Neglecting performance on target hardware

### Dependencies
- Requires completion of CF2-1 (face-api.js Integration)
- Maximum time box: 6 hours
