# Feature MS1: Environment Setup

## 1. Objective and Scope
- **Primary Goal:** Establish a complete development environment with all necessary tools, libraries, and dependencies for the JavaScript-based eye contact detection application.
- **User/System Value:** Provides the foundation for all development work, ensuring consistency across development environments and enabling efficient development workflows.
- **Feature Boundaries:** 
  - In scope: Development environment configuration, production build environment, dependency management, development workflow tools.
  - Out of scope: Actual implementation of application features, deployment to production environments.
- **Relationship to Project Goals:** A well-configured environment is essential for the successful refactoring of the application from Python to JavaScript, ensuring that all necessary tools are available and properly configured.

## 2. Functional Requirements
- **Key Capabilities:**
  - Support development of an Electron-based desktop application
  - Enable React component development and testing
  - Facilitate integration of machine learning models (TensorFlow.js)
  - Support multi-window application architecture
  - Enable automated testing and quality assurance
  - Support cross-platform development and building

- **User Interactions:**
  - Developers should be able to start the development environment with a single command
  - Changes to code should be reflected quickly during development
  - Errors and warnings should be clearly displayed

- **System Interactions:**
  - The environment should interface with the operating system to access system resources (camera, file system)
  - The environment should manage dependencies and their versions
  - The environment should support different configurations for development and production

- **Expected Outcomes:**
  - A functioning development environment that can be set up by any developer with minimal effort
  - A consistent build process that produces reliable application packages
  - A development workflow that enhances productivity and code quality

## 3. Technical Approach
- **Architectural Considerations:**
  - The environment must support Electron's main process and renderer process architecture
  - It must enable React component development and state management
  - It should support modern JavaScript/TypeScript development practices
  - It should enable hot reloading for developer productivity

- **Technology Options:**
  - Package Managers: npm or Yarn
  - Build Tools: Webpack, Electron Forge, or Electron Builder
  - Code Quality Tools: ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript
  - Testing Frameworks: Jest, React Testing Library
  - Development Enhancements: Hot Module Replacement, DevTools

- **Integration Points:**
  - The environment should integrate with code repositories for version control
  - It should support continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines
  - It should integrate with code editor tools and extensions

- **Scalability Considerations:**
  - The environment should be able to handle increasing project complexity
  - Build processes should remain efficient as the codebase grows
  - The environment should support modular development approaches

## 4. Implementation Tasks
Break down into outcome-oriented tasks that describe WHAT to accomplish, not HOW:

### Task MS1-1: Node.js and Package Manager Setup
**Objective:** Set up the foundational Node.js environment and package manager for the project.

**Full details in task file:** `/docs/features/MS1/feature_task_1.md`

### Task MS1-2: Electron Application Framework Configuration
**Objective:** Configure the Electron application framework for cross-platform desktop development.

**Full details in task file:** `/docs/features/MS1/feature_task_2.md`

### Task MS1-3: React Integration Setup
**Objective:** Integrate React for UI development within the Electron application.

**Full details in task file:** `/docs/features/MS1/feature_task_3.md`

### Task MS1-4: Development Workflow Tools Configuration
**Objective:** Set up development workflow tools for code quality, formatting, and testing.

**Full details in task file:** `/docs/features/MS1/feature_task_4.md`

### Task MS1-5: Build and Packaging Configuration
**Objective:** Configure the build and packaging process for development and production.

**Full details in task file:** `/docs/features/MS1/feature_task_5.md`

## 5. Interaction & Behavior Specifications
- **User Flow Diagrams:**
  ```
  Developer -> Clone Repository -> Run Install Command -> Start Development Server -> Make Code Changes -> See Live Updates
  ```

- **System Behavior Descriptions:**
  - When a developer runs the install command, all dependencies should be installed and the project structure should be set up
  - When a developer starts the development server, the application should launch in development mode with hot reloading enabled
  - When a developer makes code changes, the application should automatically reload to reflect those changes
  - When a developer runs the build command, a production-ready application should be created

- **State Transitions:**
  - From no environment to installed development environment
  - From development mode to production build
  - From one development iteration to the next

- **Error Scenarios:**
  - Dependency conflicts should be detected and reported clearly
  - Build failures should provide meaningful error messages
  - Development server crashes should recover automatically when possible

## 6. Testing Verification
- **Verification Approach:**
  - Manual verification of environment setup through documented steps
  - Automated verification of build processes
  - Cross-platform testing of environment setup

- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Fresh environment setup on a new machine
  - Building the application for each target platform
  - Running the development server and verifying hot reload
  - Executing automated tests in the environment

- **Success Indicators:**
  - Environment setup completes without errors
  - Development server starts and displays the application
  - Code changes are reflected in real-time during development
  - Build process creates functioning application packages

- **Edge Cases:**
  - Setup on different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux)
  - Setup with different Node.js versions
  - Recovery from interrupted installation processes
  - Handling of network issues during dependency installation
