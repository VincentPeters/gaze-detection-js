# Task MS1-1: Node.js and Package Manager Setup

## Objective
Set up the foundational Node.js environment and package manager for the project, establishing the base platform on which the eye contact detection application will be built.

## Starting Context
- **System State:** No development environment exists yet; starting from scratch.
- **Available Resources:** 
  - Original Python-based eye contact detection application code for reference
  - Documentation for Node.js, npm, and Yarn
  - Standard development tools (code editor, command line)
- **Constraints:** 
  - Must support cross-platform development (Windows, macOS, Linux)
  - Must be compatible with Electron and React requirements
  - Must enable efficient dependency management

## Expected Outcome
- **Functional Result:** A configured Node.js development environment with a functioning package manager that can install and manage dependencies.
- **System Changes:** 
  - Node.js runtime installed and configured
  - Package manager (npm or Yarn) installed and configured
  - Initial project structure established with package configuration
  - Essential base dependencies defined
- **Observable Indicators:** 
  - `package.json` file exists with correct configuration
  - Dependencies can be installed using the package manager
  - Node.js scripts can be executed

## Interaction Specification
- **Input Handling:** 
  - Package manager should accept standard commands for dependency management
  - Configuration files should be properly formatted and validated
  - Project should recognize Node.js environment variables
- **Output Generation:** 
  - Package manager should provide clear feedback during operations
  - Installation processes should report success/failure appropriately
  - Configuration should generate appropriate logs
- **Error Handling:** 
  - Dependency conflicts should be detected and reported
  - Missing or incompatible Node.js versions should trigger informative errors
  - File system permission issues should be handled gracefully
- **State Changes:** 
  - From no Node.js environment to configured environment
  - From empty project to initialized project with dependencies
  - From manual dependency management to package manager control

## Verification Approach
- **Manual Verification Steps:** 
  - Verify Node.js version with `node -v`
  - Verify package manager with `npm -v` or `yarn -v`
  - Test dependency installation with a sample package
  - Validate project initialization with basic commands
- **Automated Test Approach:** 
  - Create a simple script to validate the Node.js environment
  - Implement version checking for Node.js and package manager
  - Test dependency resolution with a sample installation
- **Integration Check Points:** 
  - Ensure Node.js version is compatible with planned Electron version
  - Verify package manager configuration works with planned workflow
  - Confirm project structure supports upcoming integration needs

## Decision Guidance
- **Key Decisions:** 
  - Choice between npm and Yarn as package manager
  - Node.js version selection and version management approach
  - Package.json configuration structure and content
  - Initial dependency selection
- **Consideration Factors:** 
  - Performance characteristics of package managers
  - Lock file behavior and dependency resolution
  - Long-term maintenance implications
  - Team familiarity and preferences
  - Cross-platform consistency
- **Tradeoff Analysis:** 
  - npm: Standard tool, universally understood vs. potentially slower
  - Yarn: Potentially faster, deterministic installations vs. additional tool
  - Latest Node.js: More features vs. potentially less stable
  - LTS Node.js: More stable vs. fewer features

## Dependencies
- **Preceding Tasks:** None (this is the first task)
- **Following Tasks:** 
  - MS1-2: Electron Application Framework Configuration
  - MS1-3: React Integration Setup
  - MS1-4: Development Workflow Tools Configuration
- **External Dependencies:** 
  - Node.js distribution
  - Package manager distribution (npm or Yarn)
  - Internet access for package downloads

## Effort Estimation
- **Complexity Assessment:** Low
- **Skill Areas:** 
  - Node.js ecosystem knowledge
  - Package management
  - JavaScript/Node.js development
  - Command line operations
- **Risk Factors:** 
  - Version incompatibilities between packages
  - Cross-platform consistency issues
  - Network connectivity for package downloads
  - System permission restrictions
