## Task CF2-3: Create Face Tracking Functionality [ ]

### Status
- [x] Not Started
- [ ] In Progress
- [ ] Complete
- [ ] Verified

### Objective
Maintain consistent tracking of faces across video frames to provide stable detection and identity even when detection temporarily fails.

### Starting Point
- Application with basic face detection from CF2-2
- Detection results without consistent identity

### Done When
- Faces maintain consistent identification across frames
- Tracking works even if detection temporarily fails
- Face IDs remain stable during normal use
- Tracking information is accessible to other components
- System can recover from tracking failures
- Tracking has minimal performance impact
- Face identity persists through brief occlusions
- New faces are assigned unique IDs when detected

### Implementation Guidelines
- Implement face tracking algorithm:
  ```javascript
  class FaceTracker {
    constructor(options = {}) {
      this.trackedFaces = [];
      this.nextId = 1;
      this.maxMissingFrames = options.maxMissingFrames || 30;
      this.matchThreshold = options.matchThreshold || 0.3;
    }
    
    update(detections) {
      // First, increment missing frames counter for all existing tracks
      this.trackedFaces.forEach(face => face.missingFrames++);
      
      // Match new detections to existing tracks
      const matchedIds = [];
      
      for (const detection of detections) {
        const box = detection.detection.box;
        let matched = false;
        
        // Try to match with existing track
        for (const trackedFace of this.trackedFaces) {
          if (matchedIds.includes(trackedFace.id)) continue;
          
          // Calculate IoU or distance to determine match
          const iou = this.calculateIoU(box, trackedFace.box);
          
          if (iou > this.matchThreshold) {
            // Update existing track
            trackedFace.box = box;
            trackedFace.detection = detection;
            trackedFace.missingFrames = 0;
            matchedIds.push(trackedFace.id);
            matched = true;
            break;
          }
        }
        
        // If no match found, create new track
        if (!matched) {
          this.trackedFaces.push({
            id: this.nextId++,
            box,
            detection,
            missingFrames: 0,
            firstSeen: Date.now()
          });
        }
      }
      
      // Remove tracks that have been missing for too long
      this.trackedFaces = this.trackedFaces.filter(
        face => face.missingFrames < this.maxMissingFrames
      );
      
      return this.trackedFaces;
    }
    
    calculateIoU(box1, box2) {
      // Intersection over Union calculation
      // ...
    }
  }
  ```

- Create face data model:
  - Unique ID for each tracked face
  - Bounding box and landmark data
  - Detection confidence
  - Tracking metadata (time visible, etc.)
  - Additional properties for eye contact

- Implement position interpolation:
  - Smooth movement between detections
  - Predict position during brief gaps
  - Maintain size consistency
  - Handle rotation/tilt gracefully

- Add track management:
  - Age out tracks after extended absence
  - Handle track merging for similar detections
  - Manage identity assignment for new detections
  - Handle tracking state persistence

- For MVP optimization:
  - Focus on single face scenario first
  - Optimize tracking algorithm for that case
  - Add multi-face handling with reasonable limits
  - Prioritize stability over complex features

- Common pitfalls to avoid:
  - Complex tracking that impacts performance
  - ID switching between similar faces
  - Poor handling of faces entering/leaving frame
  - Tracking algorithm that's hard to debug

### Dependencies
- Requires completion of CF2-2 (Basic Face Detection)
- Maximum time box: 6 hours
