## Task MS1-1: Create Basic Electron Project Structure [x]

### Status
- [ ] Not Started
- [ ] In Progress
- [x] Complete
- [ ] Verified

### Objective
Set up the minimal Electron application structure with main and renderer processes to serve as the foundation for the gaze detection application.

### Starting Point
- Empty project directory
- Node.js and npm installed on development machine

### Done When
- Basic Electron main.js file created with:
  - Proper app lifecycle management
  - Window creation and management
  - IPC setup for main-renderer communication
- Main process creates and manages a single window
- Application launches with "Hello World" content
- Developer can run the application with a single command
- Project has appropriate .gitignore and README files
- Basic LICENSE file is included

### Implementation Guidelines
- Use electron-forge to bootstrap the project:
  ```
  npx create-electron-app gaze-detection --template=webpack
  ```
- Remove any unnecessary boilerplate code and dependencies
- Focus on a clean, minimal main.js file with only essential code
- Ensure proper event handling for app lifecycle (ready, window-all-closed, activate)
- Configure proper dev tools access during development
- Implement basic error handling for application startup
- Set appropriate default window size for camera application (suggested: 800x600)
- Ensure window state persistence (position, size) is functional

- Common pitfalls to avoid:
  - Over-engineering the initial structure
  - Adding dependencies that aren't necessary for MVP
  - Neglecting proper app lifecycle management
  - Creating multiple windows prematurely

### Dependencies
- Node.js and npm installed on development machine
- Internet connection for package downloads
- Maximum time box: 4 hours
