## Task LL1-2: Implement Detection Accuracy Verification [ ]

### Status
- [x] Not Started
- [ ] In Progress
- [ ] Complete
- [ ] Verified

### Objective
Establish methods to verify eye contact detection accuracy through comparison with the original Python version and defined test scenarios.

### Starting Point
- Functional application with eye contact detection
- Original Python version available for comparison

### Done When
- Procedure exists to compare detection accuracy with Python version
- Test scenarios are defined for various conditions
- Verification includes tests with different user types
- Minimum accuracy thresholds are established
- Methods for recording and comparing results are documented
- Common failure modes are identified
- Testing reveals acceptable accuracy level
- Major discrepancies between Python and JavaScript versions are documented

### Implementation Guidelines
- Create detection accuracy test protocol:
  ```markdown
  # Eye Contact Detection Accuracy Verification Protocol
  
  ## Test Setup
  
  ### Reference System
  - Original Python application running on reference hardware
  - Standard camera positioned at eye level
  - Consistent lighting conditions (describe specifics)
  - Model version: [specify version]
  
  ### Test System
  - JavaScript application with identical camera setup
  - Same lighting conditions as reference
  - Converted model version: [specify version]
  
  ## Test Scenarios
  
  ### 1. Basic Detection Test
  
  **Procedure:**
  1. Position subject at 2 feet from camera
  2. Run both Python and JavaScript applications simultaneously
  3. Subject looks directly at camera for 10 seconds
  4. Subject looks away for 10 seconds
  5. Repeat 5 times
  6. Record detection results from both systems
  
  **Data Collection:**
  - Detection state (looking/not looking)
  - Confidence scores at 1-second intervals
  - Screenshots at state transitions
  
  **Success Criteria:**
  - State agreement between systems > 90%
  - Average confidence score difference < 0.1
  - Transition timing difference < 500ms
  ```

- Develop varied test scenarios:
  - Different distances from camera
  - Various lighting conditions
  - With/without glasses
  - Different face angles
  - Multiple faces in frame
  - Movement tests

- Create comparison methodology:
  - Side-by-side testing with both systems
  - Recording of detection state and confidence
  - Statistical analysis of results
  - Visualization of detection patterns
  - Discrepancy identification

- Implement accuracy metrics:
  - True positive rate (correctly identified eye contact)
  - False positive rate (incorrectly claimed eye contact)
  - Detection latency (time to recognize state change)
  - Confidence score correlation between versions
  - Stability of detection (lack of flickering)

- Document testing tools:
  - Setup for recording test sessions
  - Tools for analyzing results
  - Spreadsheet templates for data collection
  - Calculation of accuracy metrics
  - Comparison visualization

- Common pitfalls to avoid:
  - Inconsistent test conditions affecting results
  - Subjective interpretation of "looking"
  - Insufficient sample size for conclusions
  - Not testing edge cases and difficult scenarios
  - Comparing systems with different configuration values

### Dependencies
- Requires functional eye contact detection
- Requires access to original Python application
- Maximum time box: 6 hours
