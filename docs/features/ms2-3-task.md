## Task MS2-3: Define Basic Component Architecture [ ]

### Status
- [x] Not Started
- [ ] In Progress
- [ ] Complete
- [ ] Verified

### Objective
Create a simple component architecture that supports the application's core functionality while maintaining clean separation of concerns and reusability.

### Starting Point
- Directory structure and dependencies from previous tasks
- No defined component hierarchy or patterns

### Done When
- Component hierarchy is defined and documented
- Key components are identified with clear responsibilities
- Component communication patterns are established
- Placeholder components are created with initial props/interfaces
- Core UI state management approach is implemented
- Component structure supports all planned features
- Common patterns for styling components are defined

### Implementation Guidelines
- Define core component hierarchy:
  ```
  App
  ├── AppLayout
  │   ├── Header
  │   ├── MainContent
  │   │   ├── CameraView
  │   │   │   ├── CameraFeed
  │   │   │   └── DetectionOverlay
  │   │   ├── ControlPanel
  │   │   │   ├── DetectionControls
  │   │   │   └── CameraControls
  │   │   └── StatusDisplay
  │   └── Footer
  └── ConfigPanel (separate window or modal)
      ├── GeneralSettings
      ├── DetectionSettings
      └── CaptureSettings
  ```

- Create placeholder components with:
  - PropTypes or TypeScript interfaces
  - Basic component documentation
  - Default props where appropriate
  - Clear component responsibilities

- Implement state management approach:
  - For simple approach: React Context with reducers
  - Define main state slices (camera, detection, config)
  - Create actions and reducers for state updates
  - Provide state access patterns to components

- Define standard component patterns:
  - Functional components with hooks
  - Props destructuring pattern
  - Error boundary usage
  - Loading state handling

- Implement styling approach:
  - CSS Modules or styled-components
  - Define basic theme variables (colors, spacing)
  - Component-specific vs. shared styles
  - Responsive design considerations

- Common pitfalls to avoid:
  - Prop drilling through many component levels
  - Components with too many responsibilities
  - Overly complex state management
  - Inconsistent styling approaches

### Dependencies
- Requires completion of MS2-1 and MS2-2
- Maximum time box: 5 hours
