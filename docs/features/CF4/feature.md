# Feature CF4: Multi-face Tracking System

## 1. Objective and Scope
- **Primary Goal:** Develop a system for tracking multiple faces across frames, maintaining identity consistency and supporting simultaneous eye contact detection for multiple subjects.
- **User/System Value:** Enables the application to follow multiple people simultaneously, maintain consistent identification, and analyze eye contact for each individual even as they move or temporarily leave the frame.
- **Feature Boundaries:** 
  - In scope: Face identity tracking, multi-face state management, face re-identification, face disappearance handling, multiple subject processing.
  - Out of scope: Face recognition (identifying specific people), long-term face identity storage, UI components beyond identity visualization.
- **Relationship to Project Goals:** Multi-face tracking extends the eye contact detection to practical real-world scenarios where multiple people may be present, allowing the application to maintain consistent identity tracking across frames.

## 2. Functional Requirements
- **Key Capabilities:**
  - Track and maintain consistent IDs for multiple faces across video frames
  - Re-identify faces that disappear and reappear in the frame
  - Manage state information for each tracked face
  - Handle face disappearance and reappearance gracefully
  - Support simultaneous processing of multiple subjects
  - Coordinate tracking with eye contact detection

- **User Interactions:**
  - Users should see consistent identification of faces across frames
  - Users should be able to distinguish between different tracked faces
  - Face tracking should persist when subjects temporarily leave and return to frame

- **System Interactions:**
  - The system should assign and maintain unique IDs for detected faces
  - The system should store and update state information for each tracked face
  - The system should match reappearing faces with their previous identities
  - The system should coordinate with eye contact detection for each tracked face

- **Expected Outcomes:**
  - Reliable tracking of multiple faces simultaneously
  - Consistent identity assignment across video frames
  - Graceful handling of face disappearance and reappearance
  - Accurate association of eye contact detection with specific individuals

## 3. Technical Approach
- **Architectural Considerations:**
  - Face matching and identity assignment algorithms
  - State management for multiple tracked faces
  - Performance implications of simultaneous tracking
  - Memory management for tracking data
  - Coordination with face detection and eye contact detection

- **Technology Options:**
  - Tracking algorithms: IoU (Intersection over Union), feature-based matching
  - State management approaches: Object-oriented, functional, or hybrid
  - Identity persistence strategies: Short-term vs. long-term tracking

- **Integration Points:**
  - With face detection system for initial face information
  - With eye contact detection for per-face analysis
  - With window management for displaying multiple face panels
  - With media capture system for per-face recording

- **Scalability Considerations:**
  - Performance impact with increasing number of faces
  - Memory usage for tracking data
  - Strategies for maintaining frame rate under load
  - Limits on number of simultaneously tracked faces

## 5. Interaction & Behavior Specifications
- **User Flow Diagrams:**
  ```
  Video Feed Active -> Multiple Faces Detected -> Assign Unique IDs -> Track Across Frames -> Maintain State Per Face -> Process Eye Contact Per Face
  
  Face Disappears -> Mark as Temporarily Missing -> Continue Tracking Other Faces -> Face Reappears -> Re-identify Face -> Restore Previous State
  ```

- **System Behavior Descriptions:**
  - When a new face is detected, it should be assigned a unique identifier
  - When a face moves within the frame, its identity should be maintained
  - When a face disappears from the frame, its state should be preserved for a configurable period
  - When a previously tracked face reappears, it should be matched with its previous identity
  - When multiple faces are present, each should be tracked and processed independently

- **State Transitions:**
  - From new face detection to assigned identity
  - From tracked face to temporarily missing
  - From temporarily missing to re-identified
  - From temporarily missing to permanently lost
  - From single face tracking to multi-face tracking

- **Error Scenarios:**
  - Incorrect re-identification of similar faces
  - Identity confusion during fast movements or occlusions
  - Resource constraints affecting tracking performance
  - Tracking failures in challenging conditions
  - Handling rapid appearance/disappearance of faces

## 6. Testing Verification
- **Verification Approach:**
  - Automated tests with pre-recorded multi-person videos
  - Performance benchmarking with varying numbers of faces
  - Scenario testing for face disappearance and reappearance
  - Comparison with original Python implementation

- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Tracking multiple faces simultaneously
  - Handling face disappearance and reappearance
  - Identity persistence through occlusions
  - Performance with maximum expected number of faces
  - Edge case tracking scenarios

- **Success Indicators:**
  - Consistent identity tracking across frames
  - Accurate re-identification of returning faces
  - Graceful handling of tracking edge cases
  - Efficient performance with multiple faces
  - Reliable coordination with eye contact detection

- **Edge Cases:**
  - Very similar looking faces or twins
  - Rapid movement between frames
  - Partial occlusions of faces
  - Extreme lighting changes affecting appearance
  - Faces entering and leaving frame rapidly
