## Task LL3-4: Document Development Process [ ]

### Status
- [x] Not Started
- [ ] In Progress
- [ ] Complete
- [ ] Verified

### Objective
Create clear documentation for ongoing development processes to ensure consistent practices and enable efficient team collaboration.

### Starting Point
- Working development processes from MVP creation
- No formal documentation of the process
- Experience from MVP development

### Done When
- Documentation covers:
  - Development environment setup
  - Code standards and patterns
  - Branch and PR process
  - Testing requirements
  - Release procedures
- Documentation is accessible to all team members
- Process supports rapid iteration cycles
- Key processes have checklists or templates
- Roles and responsibilities are clearly defined
- New team members can understand the process

### Implementation Guidelines
- Create development handbook:
  ```markdown
  # Gaze Detection Development Handbook
  
  This document outlines the development processes, standards, and workflows for the Gaze Detection application.
  
  ## Development Environment
  
  ### Prerequisites
  - Node.js v14+ (LTS recommended)
  - npm v7+
  - Git
  - VSCode or preferred editor
  
  ### Setup Instructions
  
  1. Clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gaze-detection.git
     cd gaze-detection
     ```
  
  2. Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
  
  3. Set up development tools:
     ```bash
     # Install recommended VSCode extensions
     code --install-extension dbaeumer.vscode-eslint
     code --install-extension esbenp.prettier-vscode
     ```
  
  4. Start development server:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
  
  ### Recommended Tools
  - **Code Editor**: VSCode with ESLint and Prettier extensions
  - **Git Client**: Command line or GitHub Desktop
  - **API Testing**: Postman or Insomnia
  - **Debugging**: Chrome DevTools for Electron
  
  ## Code Standards
  
  ### Style Guide
  
  We follow a modified Airbnb JavaScript style guide with these key principles:
  
  - Use ES6+ features when appropriate
  - Prefer functional components with hooks for React
  - Use meaningful variable and function names
  - Keep functions small and focused
  - Comment complex logic, not obvious code
  
  ### File Organization
  
  ```
  src/
  ├── main/             # Electron main process
  ├── renderer/         # React UI components
  │   ├── components/   # Reusable UI components
  │   ├── hooks/        # Custom React hooks
  │   ├── services/     # Business logic services
  │   └── utils/        # Utility functions
  ├── shared/           # Code shared between processes
  └── assets/           # Static assets
  ```
  
  ### Naming Conventions
  
  - **Files**: kebab-case.js (e.g., face-detection.js)
  - **React Components**: PascalCase (e.g., FaceDetector.jsx)
  - **Functions**: camelCase (e.g., detectFaces())
  - **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., MAX_FACES)
  - **CSS Classes**: kebab-case (e.g., .detection-panel)
  
  ## Git Workflow
  
  ### Branch Strategy
  
  - `main`: Production-ready code
  - `dev`: Development branch for next release
  - `feature/name`: Feature branches
  - `bugfix/name`: Bug fix branches
  - `release/version`: Release preparation branches
  
  ### Commit Message Format
  
  ```
  type(scope): short description
  
  Longer description if needed
  ```
  
  Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
  
  Example: `feat(detection): add multi-face tracking`
  
  ### Pull Request Process
  
  1. Create branch from `dev`
  2. Develop and test your changes
  3. Push branch and create PR to `dev`
  4. Fill out PR template
  5. Request review from at least one team member
  6. Address review comments
  7. Merge after approval
  
  ## Testing Guidelines
  
  ### Manual Testing
  
  Before submitting a PR, verify:
  
  1. Feature works as expected
  2. No regressions in related features
  3. Performs adequately on target hardware
  4. Handles error cases gracefully
  5. UI is consistent with design patterns
  
  ### Testing Checklist
  
  - [ ] Core functionality works
  - [ ] Edge cases are handled
  - [ ] Performance is acceptable
  - [ ] UI is responsive
  - [ ] Error states are properly handled
  
  ## Release Process
  
  ### Release Preparation
  
  1. Create `release/x.y.z` branch from `dev`
  2. Update version in package.json
  3. Update CHANGELOG.md
  4. Run final testing
  5. Fix any critical issues on the release branch
  
  ### Build and Distribution
  
  1. Merge release branch to `main`
  2. Tag release in git (`vX.Y.Z`)
  3. Run build process: `npm run make`
  4. Test installation package
  5. Upload artifacts to distribution channels
  6. Merge `main` back to `dev`
  
  ### Hotfix Process
  
  1. Create `hotfix/name` branch from `main`
  2. Fix the issue and test thoroughly
  3. Create PR to `main` and `dev`
  4. Follow release process for patch version
  
  ## Rapid Iteration Workflow
  
  ### Feature Cycle
  
  1. **Plan**: Define scope and acceptance criteria
  2. **Develop**: Implement the feature
  3. **Test**: Verify functionality and performance
  4. **Review**: Get feedback from team
  5. **Refine**: Address feedback
  6. **Release**: Integrate into release branch
  
  ### Timeboxing Guidelines
  
  - **Small features**: 1-3 days
  - **Medium features**: 3-5 days
  - **Large features**: Break down into smaller tasks
  
  ### Daily Check-in
  
  - Brief status update on current tasks
  - Discussion of blockers
  - Coordination of dependencies
  - Prioritization adjustments as needed
  ```

- Create templates for key processes:
  - Pull request template
  - Issue template
  - Feature request template
  - Release checklist
  - Code review checklist

- Document technical standards:
  - Coding style guide
  - Component design patterns
  - State management approach
  - Error handling conventions
  - Performance guidelines

- Create onboarding guide:
  - Step-by-step setup instructions
  - Key architecture documentation
  - Component reference
  - Common workflows
  - Troubleshooting guide

- Common pitfalls to avoid:
  - Overly rigid processes that slow development
  - Documentation that's too abstract or theoretical
  - Process documentation that doesn't match actual practice
  - Excessive ceremony for small changes

### Dependencies
- Experience from MVP development
- Maximum time box: 5 hours
