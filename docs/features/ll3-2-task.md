## Task LL3-2: Create Issue Prioritization Framework [ ]

### Status
- [x] Not Started
- [ ] In Progress
- [ ] Complete
- [ ] Verified

### Objective
Develop a system for categorizing and prioritizing reported issues and enhancement requests to ensure efficient use of development resources.

### Starting Point
- Feedback collection mechanism from LL3-1
- Initial user feedback may be starting to come in
- No formal prioritization process

### Done When
- Framework defines:
  - Issue categories with clear criteria
  - Priority levels with decision guidelines
  - Impact assessment methodology
  - Assignment process
  - Target response times by priority
- Framework is documented for team use
- Initial feedback can be processed using the framework
- Team understands and can apply the framework
- Framework balances user needs and development constraints

### Implementation Guidelines
- Create prioritization matrix document:
  ```markdown
  # Issue Prioritization Framework
  
  This framework provides guidelines for evaluating and prioritizing issues and feature requests. It ensures that we focus our resources on the most impactful improvements.
  
  ## Issue Categories
  
  ### Bug
  An error, flaw, or unintended behavior in the application.
  
  **Examples:**
  - Application crashes or freezes
  - Feature doesn't work as designed
  - Incorrect data displayed or saved
  - Visual elements rendered incorrectly
  
  ### Performance Issue
  Problems related to application speed, resource usage, or efficiency.
  
  **Examples:**
  - Slow detection response
  - High CPU/memory usage
  - Laggy user interface
  - Slow startup time
  
  ### Usability Issue
  Problems with the user experience that make the application difficult to use.
  
  **Examples:**
  - Confusing interface elements
  - Difficult workflow
  - Poor accessibility
  - Inadequate feedback to user actions
  
  ### Feature Request
  Suggestions for new functionality or improvements to existing features.
  
  **Examples:**
  - Additional detection capabilities
  - New visualization options
  - Integration with other tools
  - Additional configuration options
  
  ### Documentation Issue
  Problems with product documentation or help resources.
  
  **Examples:**
  - Missing or incorrect instructions
  - Outdated screenshots
  - Unclear explanations
  - Typos or grammatical errors
  
  ## Priority Levels
  
  ### P0: Blocker
  Issues that prevent core application functionality for most users and have no workaround.
  
  **Criteria:**
  - Crashes affecting most users
  - Data loss or corruption
  - Security vulnerabilities
  - Complete failure of core functionality
  
  **Response Time:** Immediate (same day)
  
  **Resolution Target:** 24-48 hours
  
  ### P1: Critical
  Severely impacts core functionality but affects a subset of users or has difficult workarounds.
  
  **Criteria:**
  - Major detection accuracy problems
  - Critical feature unavailable
  - Severe performance degradation
  - Serious usability blockers for key workflows
  
  **Response Time:** 1 business day
  
  **Resolution Target:** 3-5 business days
  
  ### P2: Major
  Impacts important functionality but has reasonable workarounds.
  
  **Criteria:**
  - Moderate detection problems
  - Secondary feature unavailable
  - Noticeable performance issues
  - Important usability problems
  
  **Response Time:** 2-3 business days
  
  **Resolution Target:** Next release cycle
  
  ### P3: Minor
  Small functional or visual issues that don't significantly impact usage.
  
  **Criteria:**
  - Edge case bugs
  - Minor visual glitches
  - Small usability improvements
  - Documentation issues
  
  **Response Time:** 5 business days
  
  **Resolution Target:** Prioritized against other improvements
  
  ### P4: Enhancement
  Feature requests and nice-to-have improvements.
  
  **Criteria:**
  - New feature requests
  - Optimizations for specific use cases
  - Visual or UX improvements
  - Additional configuration options
  
  **Response Time:** Acknowledgment within 5 business days
  
  **Resolution Target:** Evaluated for roadmap inclusion
  
  ## Impact Assessment
  
  When determining priority, evaluate using these factors:
  
  1. **User Impact**: How many users are affected?
     - All users: +2 priority points
     - Many users: +1 priority point
     - Few users: +0 priority points
  
  2. **Frequency**: How often does the issue occur?
     - Always: +2 priority points
     - Sometimes: +1 priority point
     - Rarely: +0 priority points
  
  3. **Workaround**: Is there a reasonable workaround?
     - No workaround: +2 priority points
     - Difficult workaround: +1 priority point
     - Simple workaround: +0 priority points
  
  4. **Business Impact**: How does this affect the project goals?
     - Severe impact: +2 priority points
     - Moderate impact: +1 priority point
     - Minor impact: +0 priority points
  
  **Total Score Interpretation:**
  - 7-8 points: Consider P0 or P1
  - 5-6 points: Consider P1 or P2
  - 3-4 points: Consider P2 or P3
  - 0-2 points: Consider P3 or P4
  
  ## Assignment Process
  
  1. **Initial Triage**: Product owner reviews new issues daily
  2. **Categorization**: Assign category and assess impact
  3. **Prioritization**: Assign priority level based on framework
  4. **Assignment**: Assign to appropriate team member based on:
     - Expertise
     - Current workload
     - Issue context/history
  5. **Communication**: Notify stakeholders of high-priority issues
  
  ## Review Process
  
  - Review issue priorities weekly during team meetings
  - Adjust priorities based on new information
  - Escalate issues that aren't progressing
  - Re-evaluate enhancement requests at the end of each release cycle
  ```

- Create application for managing issues:
  - Use GitHub Issues or similar platform
  - Configure with custom labels for categories and priorities
  - Create issue templates that prompt for needed information
  - Set up notifications for high-priority issues

- Implement initial triage process:
  - Define who does initial triage
  - Create checklist for prioritization factors
  - Establish communication channels for urgent issues
  - Document verification steps for bug reports

- Develop team documentation:
  - Create onboarding document for new team members
  - Provide examples of properly categorized issues
  - Add guidelines for writing good issue descriptions
  - Include templates for common responses

- Common pitfalls to avoid:
  - Overly complex prioritization that slows decision-making
  - Prioritizing based on who reported the issue
  - Ignoring chronic minor issues
  - Subjective prioritization without clear criteria

### Dependencies
- Requires feedback collection mechanism (LL3-1)
- Maximum time box: 4 hours
