# Task CF1-2: Video Capture Implementation

## Objective
Implement reliable video stream capture from selected camera devices with configurable parameters, establishing the foundation for real-time video processing necessary for eye contact detection.

## Starting Context
- **System State:** 
  - Development environment has been set up (MS1)
  - Project structure and architecture have been defined (MS2)
  - Basic window management system is in place (MS3)
  - Camera device enumeration and selection exists (CF1-1)
  - No video capture functionality exists yet
- **Available Resources:** 
  - Electron/browser MediaDevices and MediaStream API documentation
  - Camera device selection implementation
  - Project architecture and window management system
  - Inter-process communication framework
- **Constraints:** 
  - Must work with various camera hardware and capabilities
  - Must be performant for real-time processing
  - Must support configurable capture parameters
  - Must work within Electron's security model
  - Must handle resource constraints appropriately

## Expected Outcome
- **Functional Result:** A robust video capture system that streams video from selected camera devices with configurable parameters and prepares frames for processing.
- **System Changes:** 
  - Video stream initialization and management
  - Capture parameter configuration (resolution, frame rate)
  - Frame acquisition mechanism
  - Stream lifecycle management (start, stop, pause)
  - Resource management for efficient capture
- **Observable Indicators:** 
  - Video streams are successfully captured from selected devices
  - Frame capture operates at the specified frame rate
  - Resolution and other parameters can be configured
  - Video capture reliably starts and stops on demand
  - System resources are used efficiently during capture

## Interaction Specification
- **Input Handling:** 
  - Camera device selection from enumeration system
  - Capture parameter configurations
  - Stream control commands (start, stop, pause)
  - Device capability constraints
  - Resource availability information
- **Output Generation:** 
  - Continuous video frame stream
  - Frame metadata (timestamp, resolution, format)
  - Stream status and statistics
  - Resource usage information
  - Error and status notifications
- **Error Handling:** 
  - Stream initialization failures
  - Device access errors after initial permission
  - Parameter configuration issues
  - Resource constraint violations
  - Stream interruption or quality degradation
- **State Changes:** 
  - From device selection to active stream
  - Between different capture parameter configurations
  - From active to stopped/paused stream states
  - During error recovery processes
  - When switching between camera devices

## Verification Approach
- **Manual Verification Steps:** 
  - Verify successful video capture from selected devices
  - Test different resolution and frame rate configurations
  - Confirm stream control functionality (start, stop, pause)
  - Check performance under extended operation
  - Test behavior with various camera hardware
- **Automated Test Approach:** 
  - Create tests for stream initialization and management
  - Test parameter configuration effects
  - Implement resource usage monitoring tests
  - Verify frame delivery performance
  - Test error handling and recovery scenarios
- **Integration Check Points:** 
  - Ensure proper integration with device enumeration
  - Verify compatibility with frame processing pipeline
  - Check resource coordination with other system components
  - Confirm proper handling of security constraints
  - Test performance in conjunction with window system

  - Compatibility across platforms and devices
  - Memory and CPU usage considerations
  - Reliability under extended operation
  - Integration with subsequent processing steps
- **Tradeoff Analysis:** 
  - High vs. low resolution capture
  - High vs. low frame rate
  - Complex vs. simple parameter configuration
  - Extensive vs. minimal error handling
  - Buffer size vs. latency considerations
