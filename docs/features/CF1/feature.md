# Feature CF1: Camera Integration & Video Feed

## 1. Objective and Scope
- **Primary Goal:** Integrate camera access and video feed processing capabilities, allowing the application to capture and process video input from various camera sources for eye contact detection.
- **User/System Value:** Provides the foundational video input capability essential for all subsequent face and eye contact detection features, enabling the core functionality of the application.
- **Feature Boundaries:** 
  - In scope: Camera device selection, video stream capture, frame processing pipeline, camera permissions, video feed display.
  - Out of scope: Face detection, eye contact detection, UI components beyond basic video display.
- **Relationship to Project Goals:** Camera integration is the primary input mechanism for the eye contact detection application, providing the visual data necessary for all detection and tracking functionality.

## 2. Functional Requirements
- **Key Capabilities:**
  - Access and enumerate available camera devices
  - Allow users to select from multiple camera sources
  - Capture video streams with configurable resolution and frame rate
  - Process video frames for use in detection algorithms
  - Display the video feed to users with minimal latency
  - Handle camera permissions and access restrictions

- **User Interactions:**
  - Users should be able to select from available camera devices
  - Users should see a preview of the camera feed
  - Users should be notified about camera access permissions
  - Users should be able to adjust basic camera settings (resolution, frame rate)

- **System Interactions:**
  - The system should request camera permissions from the operating system
  - The system should capture frames from the selected camera device
  - The system should process frames for use in detection algorithms
  - The system should handle camera disconnection or errors gracefully

- **Expected Outcomes:**
  - Reliable camera device detection and selection
  - Smooth video capture with configurable parameters
  - Efficient frame processing pipeline
  - Responsive video display with minimal latency
  - Proper handling of camera permissions and errors

## 3. Technical Approach
- **Architectural Considerations:**
  - Performance implications of video capture and processing
  - Security and permission constraints across platforms
  - Integration with Electron's process model
  - Frame processing pipeline design
  - Balance between quality and performance

- **Technology Options:**
  - Web APIs: MediaDevices, getUserMedia, MediaStream
  - Video Processing: Canvas API, WebGL
  - Performance Optimization: Web Workers, GPU acceleration
  - Camera Integration: navigator.mediaDevices vs Electron APIs

- **Integration Points:**
  - With operating system for device access and permissions
  - With window management for video display
  - With face detection system for frame processing
  - With configuration system for camera settings

- **Scalability Considerations:**
  - Support for multiple simultaneous camera inputs
  - Performance optimization for high-resolution streams
  - Resource management to prevent system overload
  - Adaptability to different camera hardware capabilities

**Full details in task file:** `/docs/features/CF1/feature_task_5.md`

## 5. Interaction & Behavior Specifications
- **User Flow Diagrams:**
  ```
  Application Launch -> Request Camera Permission -> Display Available Cameras -> User Selects Camera -> Video Stream Starts -> Display Video Feed
  
  Video Feed Active -> User Changes Camera -> Release Previous Camera -> Initialize New Camera -> Display New Video Feed
  ```

- **System Behavior Descriptions:**
  - When the application starts, it should request camera permissions if not already granted
  - When permissions are granted, the system should enumerate available camera devices
  - When a camera is selected, the system should initialize the video stream with appropriate parameters
  - When frames are captured, they should be processed and made available for detection algorithms
  - When a camera becomes unavailable, the system should notify the user and attempt to recover

- **State Transitions:**
  - From no camera access to permission granted
  - From camera selection to active video stream
  - From one camera device to another
  - From normal operation to error handling

- **Error Scenarios:**
  - Camera access denied by user or system
  - Camera disconnected during operation
  - Resource constraints affecting video performance
  - Initialization failures for specific camera devices
  - Frame processing errors or performance issues

## 6. Testing Verification
- **Verification Approach:**
  - Manual testing with various camera devices
  - Automated tests for frame processing pipeline
  - Performance testing under different conditions
  - Cross-platform testing of camera access

- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Camera enumeration and selection
  - Video capture with different resolutions and frame rates
  - Frame processing pipeline performance
  - Camera permission handling
  - Error recovery in various scenarios

- **Success Indicators:**
  - Successful detection and selection of camera devices
  - Smooth video capture with expected quality
  - Efficient frame processing with minimal latency
  - Proper handling of permissions and errors
  - Consistent performance across different platforms

- **Edge Cases:**
  - Systems with multiple cameras of varying capabilities
  - Virtual or emulated camera devices
  - Very high or very low resolution cameras
  - Camera disconnection during active use
  - Limited system resources affecting performance
