# Task CF1-1: Camera Device Enumeration and Selection

## Objective
Create a system to detect, enumerate, and allow selection of available camera devices, providing users with a clear interface to choose their preferred camera input source.

## Starting Context
- **System State:** 
  - Development environment has been set up (MS1)
  - Project structure and architecture have been defined (MS2)
  - Basic window management system is in place (MS3)
  - No camera integration exists yet
- **Available Resources:** 
  - Electron/browser MediaDevices API documentation
  - Window management system for UI integration
  - Inter-process communication framework
  - Project architecture definitions
- **Constraints:** 
  - Must be compatible with multiple operating systems
  - Must handle various camera hardware configurations
  - Must respect security and privacy considerations
  - Must work within Electron's process model
  - Must support dynamic device availability

## Expected Outcome
- **Functional Result:** A reliable system that detects, enumerates, and enables selection of available camera devices, integrated with the application's user interface.
- **System Changes:** 
  - Camera device detection and enumeration mechanism
  - Device information collection and display
  - Camera selection interface and logic
  - Device state tracking and management
  - Integration with application configuration
- **Observable Indicators:** 
  - Application correctly identifies all available camera devices
  - Users can view a list of available cameras with relevant information
  - Camera selection is persisted between application sessions
  - Device changes (connection/disconnection) are detected and handled
  - Selected camera information is available to other system components

## Interaction Specification
- **Input Handling:** 
  - System should detect available camera devices
  - User selection of camera device should be captured
  - Device change events should be recognized
  - Configuration settings for default devices should be applied
- **Output Generation:** 
  - List of available camera devices with relevant information
  - Confirmation of selected camera device
  - Notification of device changes
  - Selected device information for other system components
- **Error Handling:** 
  - No cameras available scenario
  - Permission denied for device enumeration
  - Device enumeration failures
  - Selected device no longer available
  - Device information retrieval errors
- **State Changes:** 
  - From no camera information to enumerated devices
  - From available devices to selected device
  - From one selected device to another
  - From available to unavailable device states
  - From normal operation to error recovery

## Verification Approach
- **Manual Verification Steps:** 
  - Verify detection of all connected camera devices
  - Test camera selection interface
  - Confirm persistence of camera selection
  - Test with device connection/disconnection
  - Check behavior with various camera configurations
- **Automated Test Approach:** 
  - Create tests for device enumeration
  - Test device selection logic
  - Simulate device connection/disconnection events
  - Verify configuration persistence
  - Test error handling scenarios
- **Integration Check Points:** 
  - Ensure proper integration with window management system
  - Verify communication with other system components
  - Check compatibility with configuration system
  - Confirm interface with video capture system
  - Test permission handling integration

## Decision Guidance
- **Key Decisions:** 
  - Device enumeration approach (MediaDevices API vs. Electron-specific)
  - Device information display format
  - Selection interface design
  - Device state tracking mechanism
  - Default device selection strategy
- **Consideration Factors:** 
  - Cross-platform compatibility
  - Performance of device enumeration
  - User experience for device selection
  - Reliability of device tracking
  - Privacy and security considerations
- **Tradeoff Analysis:** 
  - Comprehensive vs. simple device information
  - Automatic vs. manual device selection
  - Frequent vs. on-demand device enumeration
  - Detailed vs. minimal error handling
  - Native vs. web API approaches
