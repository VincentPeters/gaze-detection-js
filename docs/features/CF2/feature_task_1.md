# Task CF2-1: Face Detection Model Integration

## Objective
Integrate face-api.js with the application and implement basic face detection capabilities, establishing the foundation for identifying human faces in the video stream for subsequent eye contact analysis.

## Starting Context
- **System State:** 
  - Development environment has been set up (MS1)
  - Project structure and architecture have been defined (MS2)
  - Basic window management system is in place (MS3)
  - Camera integration and video feed are functional (CF1)
  - No face detection capability exists yet
- **Available Resources:** 
  - face-api.js library and documentation
  - TensorFlow.js as the underlying framework
  - Video frame processing pipeline
  - Project architecture definitions
- **Constraints:** 
  - Must operate efficiently for real-time processing
  - Must work within browser/Electron rendering constraints
  - Must support multiple face detection models for flexibility
  - Must be compatible with the existing video processing pipeline
  - Must balance accuracy with performance

## Expected Outcome

## Verification Approach
- **Manual Verification Steps:** 
  - Verify successful model loading
  - Test face detection with live video input
  - Check detection accuracy with various conditions
  - Confirm performance is suitable for real-time use
  - Test with different face orientations and distances
- **Automated Test Approach:** 
  - Create tests for model loading and initialization
  - Implement detection accuracy tests with sample images
  - Test performance benchmarks
  - Verify integration with video pipeline
  - Test error handling and recovery scenarios
- **Integration Check Points:** 
  - Ensure proper integration with video frame pipeline
  - Verify compatibility with application architecture
  - Check resource usage patterns
  - Confirm output format meets requirements for subsequent processing
