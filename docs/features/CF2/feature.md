# Feature CF2: Face Detection Implementation

## 1. Objective and Scope
- **Primary Goal:** Implement face detection using face-api.js to identify and locate faces within the video feed, providing the foundation for eye contact detection.
- **User/System Value:** Enables the core capability of identifying human faces in the video stream, which is essential for subsequent eye contact analysis and tracking.
- **Feature Boundaries:** 
  - In scope: Face detection integration, face landmark extraction, detection parameter configuration, face region extraction, real-time performance optimization.
  - Out of scope: Eye contact detection logic, multi-face tracking persistence, UI components beyond basic detection visualization.
- **Relationship to Project Goals:** Face detection is a critical prerequisite for eye contact detection, as it identifies and locates the faces that will be analyzed for eye contact.

## 5. Interaction & Behavior Specifications
- **User Flow Diagrams:**
  ```
  Video Feed Active -> Face Detection Process -> Faces Found -> Extract Landmarks -> Prepare Face Regions -> Visualize Results
  
  User Adjusts Detection Parameters -> Parameters Updated -> Detection Behavior Changes -> New Results Displayed
  ```

- **System Behavior Descriptions:**
  - When a video frame is received, the system should analyze it for faces
  - When faces are detected, their landmarks should be extracted
  - When landmarks are extracted, face regions should be prepared for further analysis
  - When detection parameters are adjusted, the detection behavior should update accordingly
  - When detection results are available, they should be visualized for feedback

- **State Transitions:**
  - From unprocessed frame to detected faces
  - From raw face detection to extracted landmarks
  - From landmarks to prepared face regions
  - From one set of detection parameters to another

- **Error Scenarios:**
  - No faces detected in the frame
  - Low confidence detections requiring special handling
  - Performance degradation affecting real-time capability
  - Model loading or initialization failures
  - Facial landmark extraction failures

## 6. Testing Verification
- **Verification Approach:**
  - Automated tests with pre-recorded video sequences
  - Performance benchmarking across different devices
  - Comparison with original Python implementation
  - Manual testing with varied face scenarios

- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Face detection with different lighting conditions
  - Detection with multiple faces at varying distances
  - Detection with faces at different angles
  - Performance testing with continuous operation
  - Detection parameter adjustment testing

- **Success Indicators:**
  - Detection accuracy comparable to original implementation
  - Consistent landmark extraction quality
