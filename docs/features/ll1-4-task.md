## Task LL1-4: Establish Issue Tracking Process [ ]

### Status
- [x] Not Started
- [ ] In Progress
- [ ] Complete
- [ ] Verified

### Objective
Create a simple system for tracking and prioritizing issues found during testing to ensure they are addressed systematically.

### Starting Point
- Test procedures and initial testing results
- No formal issue tracking process

### Done When
- Issue tracking system is in place (GitHub Issues or similar)
- Issue template includes critical information fields
- Severity/priority system is defined and documented
- Process for tracking fixes is established
- Major issues from initial testing are documented
- Team understands how to use the issue system
- Reporting process is accessible to testers
- Issue lifecycle is defined

### Implementation Guidelines
- Set up issue tracking system:
  - Use GitHub Issues if project is on GitHub
  - Create project in Jira, Trello, or similar if needed
  - Set up appropriate labels and milestones
  - Configure notifications for new issues

- Create comprehensive issue template:
  ```markdown
  ## Issue Template
  
  ### Description
  [Clear description of the issue]
  
  ### Steps to Reproduce
  1. [First step]
  2. [Second step]
  3. [Continue as needed]
  
  ### Expected Behavior
  [What should happen]
  
  ### Actual Behavior
  [What actually happens]
  
  ### Environment
  - **OS**: [e.g. Windows 10, macOS 12.0]
  - **Application Version**: [e.g. 0.1.0]
  - **Hardware**: [Relevant specs - CPU, RAM, etc.]
  - **Camera**: [Camera model if relevant]
  
  ### Severity
  - [ ] Critical - Application crash, data loss, unusable
  - [ ] Major - Core functionality broken
  - [ ] Moderate - Function works but with significant issues
  - [ ] Minor - Cosmetic or small functional issue
  
  ### Screenshots/Videos
  [If applicable, add screenshots or videos]
  
  ### Additional Context
  [Any other relevant information]
  ```

- Define issue priority system:
  ```markdown
  ## Issue Priority Levels
  
  ### P0: Blocker
  - Prevents testing or use of core application functionality
  - Causes application crash or freeze
  - Results in data loss
  - Must be fixed immediately before release
  
  ### P1: Critical
  - Severely impacts core functionality
  - Has no workaround
  - Affects all users
  - Must be fixed before release
  
  ### P2: Major
  - Impacts important functionality
  - May have difficult workarounds
  - Affects many users
  - Should be fixed before release if possible
  
  ### P3: Minor
  - Small functional or visual issues
  - Has easy workarounds
  - Affects few users or edge cases
  - Can be deferred until after initial release
  
  ### P4: Trivial
  - Cosmetic issues
  - No functional impact
  - Lowest priority for fixing
  ```

- Document issue lifecycle:
  - Issue creation and triage process
  - Assignment procedure
  - Resolution workflow
  - Verification process
  - Closure criteria

- Create reporting procedure:
  - How testers should report issues
  - Required information for reports
  - Screenshots and video capture guidelines
  - Communication channels for questions
  - Response expectations

- Document common issue categories:
  - Detection accuracy issues
  - Performance problems
  - UI/UX concerns
  - Camera and hardware compatibility
  - Configuration and settings issues

- Common pitfalls to avoid:
  - Overly complex issue workflow
  - Insufficient information in reports
  - Poor prioritization leading to wasted effort
  - Neglecting issue verification
  - Lack of clear ownership

### Dependencies
- Requires completion of LL1-1, LL1-2, and LL1-3
- Access to chosen issue tracking system
- Maximum time box: 4 hours
