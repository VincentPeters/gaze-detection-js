- [ ] Feature Complete

## 1. Purpose & Value
- **Goal:** Create the essential application structure and organization to support development of core functionality
- **Value:** Provides a clean, organized foundation that makes subsequent feature development faster and more coherent
- **Success Criteria:** Project has a clear structure with essential dependencies, configuration management, and patterns established

## 2. Functional Requirements
- **Must Have:**
  - Well-defined application directory structure
  - Essential dependencies installed and configured
  - Basic component architecture outline
  - Configuration loading and saving mechanism
  - Project documentation foundation

- **Won't Have:**
  - Complex state management patterns
  - Advanced component libraries or UI frameworks
  - Database integration
  - Authentication systems
  - Comprehensive documentation

## 3. Implementation Tasks

### Task MS2-1: Create Application Directory Structure
**Objective:** Establish a clean, organized directory structure for the project

**Starting Point:**
- Basic Electron/React application from MS1

**Done When:**
- Directory structure is defined for:
  - Main process code
  - Renderer process components
  - Shared utilities
  - Configuration files
  - Assets (including ML models)
  - Documentation
- README documents the structure

**Simplest Approach:**
- Use a flat, function-focused structure
- Keep structure shallow to avoid navigation complexity
- Create minimal placeholder files where needed
- Focus on clarity over theoretical "correctness"

### Task MS2-2: Install Essential Dependencies
**Objective:** Add all core dependencies needed for MVP functionality

**Starting Point:**
- Basic Electron/React application with directory structure

**Done When:**
- All required dependencies are installed:
  - face-api.js for face detection
  - TensorFlow.js for running the eye contact model
  - State management solution (React Context or minimal Redux)
  - File system access utilities
  - Basic UI components
- Dependencies are documented with purpose
- Package.json scripts are configured for development

**Simplest Approach:**
- Install only what's needed for MVP
- Use established, well-documented libraries
- Prefer smaller, focused packages over large frameworks
- Avoid dependencies with complex configuration requirements

### Task MS2-3: Define Basic Component Architecture
**Objective:** Create a simple component architecture that supports the application's core functionality

**Starting Point:**
- Directory structure and dependencies from previous tasks

**Done When:**
- Component hierarchy is defined
- Key components are identified with clear responsibilities
- Component communication patterns are established
- Placeholder components are created

**Simplest Approach:**
- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep component responsibilities focused
- Use simple parent-child prop passing for most communication
- Implement only the components needed for core user flow

### Task MS2-4: Implement Configuration Management
**Objective:** Create a system for loading, saving, and accessing application configuration

**Starting Point:**
- Application with directory structure and dependencies

**Done When:**
- Configuration can be loaded from and saved to disk
- Default configuration is defined
- Configuration is accessible throughout the application
- Basic validation prevents critical configuration errors

**Simplest Approach:**
- Use Electron Store for persistent configuration
- Define a simple JSON structure for configuration
- Implement only critical configuration options
- Provide sensible defaults for all settings

## 4. Basic Testing Approach
- **Manual Test:** Verify directory structure is clean and logical, dependencies install without errors, and configuration loads and saves properly
- **Edge Cases:** 
  - Application handles missing/corrupt configuration
  - Project builds correctly on a fresh clone
  - Dependencies install correctly in a clean environment

## 5. Dependencies
- **Required Before:**
  - MS1 (Essential Environment)
  
- **Enables:**
  - CF1 (User Journey Skeleton)
  - CF2 (Data Essentials)
  - CF3 (Critical Business Logic)
